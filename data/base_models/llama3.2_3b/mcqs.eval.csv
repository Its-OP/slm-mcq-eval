**Rubric:** Management  

Withdrawal remains beneficial at all stages of pregnancy. The general principles of withdrawal are the same as outside pregnancy.

Appropriate nicotine replacement therapy is often necessary to help pregnant women give up smoking. To adapt the dosage, dependence on nicotine should be assessed prior to pregnancy using the Fagerström questionnaire, and sometimes the level of intoxication should be measured by means of exhaled CO (CO analyzer).

Medical interventions to help people stop smoking are essentially individualized aids. There are several types:

- Advice and information tailored to the smoker's motivation and history, delivered to the patient using a variety of media: factsheets, electronic resources, or telephone calls.
- Information given to the woman on her level of smoking by objective measurement (CO analyzer).
- Psychological and/or behavioral approaches:
  - Minimal advice on quitting: asking about smoking status, whether there is a plan to quit, and providing a simple written document on the subject.
  - Brief intervention: involves probing the interview with open-ended questions.
  - Motivational interviewing: seeks out and highlights the patient's personal motivations for considering or building up withdrawal.
  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy: involves developing practical ways of getting around and overcoming cravings.
  - Psychological consultation.
  - Addictology consultation in the case of associated drug use.
- Nicotine prescription given to the patient in the event of pharmacological dependence.
- Other interventions that have been evaluated include hypnosis.

Neonatal blood screening is systematically carried out on blotting paper at around 72 hours of life (not before 48 hours). Clear and comprehensible information must be given to the parents, and written consent is recorded before the blood sample is taken. Parents are only notified if there is an abnormal result requiring a follow-up test. This screening concerns six diseases:

- **Phenylketonuria**  
  - Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency → screening = increased phenylalanine dosage  
  - Neonatal warning signs: none  
  - Risk of psychomotor retardation in the absence of treatment (phenylalanine-controlled diet).

- **Congenital Hypothyroidism**  
  - L-Thyroxine secretion deficiency due to thyroid dysgenesis (athyreosis, hypoplasia, ectopia) or hormonogenesis disorder (thyroid gland in place) → screening: elevation of TSH blood level  
  - Neonatal warning signs: prolonged jaundice, constipation, hypotonia, sucking difficulties, wide fontanelles, hypothermia, macroglossia. Risk of psychomotor retardation, osteodystrophy, growth retardation in the absence of treatment (thyroid hormone replacement).

- **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia**  
  - 21-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency (>95% of cases), leading to cortisol and aldosterone deficiency and excess androgen production → screening: elevation of 17-OH-progesterone blood levels  
  - Neonatal call signs: salt loss syndrome with vomiting, dehydration, and metabolic disorders (hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia). In girls, virilisation of the external genitalia visible from birth.  
  - Treatment: hydrocortisone replacement, fludrocortisone, and sodium supplementation.

- **Cystic Fibrosis**  
  - Mutations in the CFTR gene encoding a transmembrane protein regulating chloride ion transport → screening: increased immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) blood levels.  
  - Neonatal signs: meconium ileus, retentional cholestatic jaundice.

- **Sickle Cell Disease**  
  - Structural abnormality of the β chain of globin leading to the production of abnormal haemoglobin S → screening: haemoglobin electrophoresis (specific HbS band and absence of HbA band).

**Title:** Knowing the Most Common Clinical Manifestations of Internal Hemorrhoids  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

Haemorrhoidal symptoms linked to the internal plexuses can be expressed in two ways: either noisily over a short period of time (haemorrhoidal crisis) or as long-lasting symptoms accentuated during and after defecation.

Haemorrhoidal crisis combines, to varying degrees, a sensation of burning, tension, or sharp pain in the anus, red defecatory bleeding (anal epistaxis) which can be significant but is not mixed with stool, and sensitive anal swelling or a perception of internal tension. Symptoms occur rapidly and last for a few days, often accentuated by defecation.

When the signs become chronic, they often include defecatory and post-defecatory anal burning that does not last long, more or less significant prolapse of the anus that is more or less reducible after defecation, and bleeding. These symptoms may develop periodically. Anal pruritus is a complaint often attributed to haemorrhoids, but the causal relationship is tenuous. It should not be considered a haemorrhoidal symptom, particularly if it is chronic. Instrumental or surgical treatment of haemorrhoids should not be proposed in cases of chronic anal pruritus.

The classification of haemorrhoidal tissue into grades is classic:

- Grade I: No prolapse in the anoscopic lumen.
- Grade II: Prolapse in the lumen of the anoscopy but not outside.
- Grade III: Prolapse outside the anus during pushing but spontaneous reintegration at the end of pushing.
- Grade IV: Permanent prolapse from the outset. In this situation, the internal haemorrhoids are visible outside the anus, and anoscopy is often not necessary to visualize them.

The important value of the clinical examination lies not only in describing the haemorrhoidal tissue but also in looking for associated lesions: anal fissure in the radiating folds (often at the posterior pole of the anus, the anal fissure is an inspection diagnosis), anal abscess or fistula, condyloma, marisci, cancer of the anal canal or rectum.",0.75,,False,False,0.8134604096412659,0.6508270303408304,b,False,2,2

Symptoms occur in the hours following cessation of consumption, typically in the morning upon waking in highly dependent individuals. Symptoms peak within the first 72 hours and can last up to 7-10 days after stopping drinking.

- Tremor (SD-128), profound sweating (SD-025), anxiety (SD-116), and vomiting (SD-013).
- Other signs:
  - Insomnia (SD-135), nightmares, irritability, agitation (SD-114)
  - Tachycardia, high blood pressure
  - Nausea, anorexia, diarrhea

These symptoms disappear or diminish with alcohol or benzodiazepines.

**Withdrawal Complications**

Seizures (SD-120) or delirium tremens, which carry a significant risk of death.

**Convulsive Withdrawal Seizures**

Occur within 48 hours of stopping or significantly reducing alcohol consumption (rarely later). These are tonic-clonic generalized seizures with a risk of rapid recurrence, malignant state, and progression to delirium tremens.

**Delirium Tremens**

A state of confusion characterized by agitation and delirium.

- Agitation
- Major tremors
- Incoherent speech with dreamlike delirium and intense delusional experiences
- Multi-sensorial hallucinations, especially visual (zoopsies), or experiences of aggression scenes (fear reactions: risk of running away or aggression)
- Moderate fever, profuse sweating, changes in blood pressure, tachycardia

== Definitions ==

### a) Hygienic Dietary Rules

Hygienic dietary rules are a major element in the therapeutic management of haemorrhoidal disease. Dietary exclusion diets are not effective. Generally speaking, dietary hygiene rules aim to combat chronic constipation. Treating chronic constipation is a common-sense measure aimed at limiting the onset of haemorrhoidal disease, preventing recurrences, and perhaps even complications. Dietary changes that help to correct stool consistency and regulate transit are recommended. Introducing a diet rich in soluble fiber (linseed, chia seeds, blond psyllium, etc.) and correcting constipation can reduce the time spent having a bowel movement and reduce dyschezia. This helps to resolve symptoms in the acute phase of haemorrhoidal attacks, prevent attacks, and treat chronic haemorrhoidal disease.

### b) Medication

**Treatment of Internal Haemorrhoidal Disease:**

Diosmin has proven efficacy in the treatment of haemorrhoidal attacks because it reduces the intensity and duration of symptoms. Local topicals include all emollient products for topical application (creams, ointments, and suppositories). They contain agents capable of reducing the inflammatory component of the haemorrhoidal crisis, acting on the oedematous component of the crisis, and promoting healing. Some topicals also have analgesic properties through local anaesthetics. Like the class of venotonics, these drugs are offered as short courses of treatment for haemorrhoidal attacks. They are not indicated in cases of chronic pathology, mainly dominated by bleeding or defecatory anal procidence.

**Treatment of External Haemorrhoidal Disease:**

The only manifestation of external haemorrhoids is external haemorrhoidal thrombosis, which is treated by incision or excision. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are an alternative to incision/excision. Short courses of corticosteroids are an alternative in cases where NSAIDs and surgical treatment are contraindicated, particularly where there is a strong oedematous component.

### c) Principles of Instrumental and Surgical Treatments

The term ""instrumental haemorrhoid treatment"" refers to all procedures carried out to constrain the haemorrhoidal anal procidence, reinforce the supporting tissue, and form a scar at the top of the haemorrhoid. These therapeutic methods are carried out on an outpatient basis, through an anoscopy, and most often during a specialised gastroenterology consultation. These strategies constitute the basic treatment for chronic haemorrhoidal disease. They should not be carried out during a flare-up of the disease and do not represent a preventive treatment for external haemorrhoidal thrombosis. Various techniques can be used to create a chemical (sclerosis), ischaemic (elastic ligation), or thermal (infrared, bipolar coagulation, cryotherapy) eschar. The treatment is applied in a sector, in the rectal mucosa (no thermoalgesic sensitivity) above (and not on top of) the internal haemorrhoidal tissue. These methods do not remove or sclerotise the haemorrhoidal tissue itself. When the indications are well-targeted, they provide significant benefit more than three times out of four. However, their effectiveness decreases with the length of follow-up. These methods may give rise to rare complications (bleeding following the fall of an eschar, infections). Elastic ligation offers the best risk/benefit ratio but is contraindicated in patients taking anticoagulants.

""Surgical haemorrhoid treatment"" describes all procedures designed to treat haemorrhoidal tissue under general, peridural, or locoregional anaesthetic. There are two types of haemorrhoidal surgery: those which remove the haemorrhoidal tissue (known as haemorrhoidectomy) and those which fix or tighten the haemorrhoidal tissue using a mechanical process (pexy with wire or mechanical forceps) or heat (radiofrequency, laser). The first type is the benchmark in terms of effectiveness and is often the only procedure possible in cases of anatomically advanced haemorrhoidal disease or recurrent external thrombosis. The second type is more similar to the instrumental treatments mentioned above: it is simpler, often quicker, and less painful. Patients are often immobilised for a shorter period after the procedure. There is a greater risk of recurrence. Complications are inherent in any type of surgery, but rare functional sequelae such as incontinence must be prevented and assessed before the procedure.

The treatment of external haemorrhoidal thrombosis is not, strictly speaking, a surgical procedure. However, an incision or excision can easily be performed in consultation. With a few precautions and a little patience, this strategy is effective in relieving pain and shortening its course. The alternative is to prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",0.6666666666666666,13.860000000000003,False,True,0.8074430227279663,0.6597668329874674,b,False,2,2

**Title:** Know the Clinical Signs of Vitreous Haemorrhage and Its Main Causes  
**Description:** Visual acuity, visual field, VEP, OCT

Intravitreal haemorrhage causes a drop in visual acuity, often preceded by an impression of ""sooty rain.""

The reduction in visual acuity varies greatly depending on the extent of the haemorrhage. A minimal intravitreal haemorrhage may manifest mainly as myodesopsia, with no reduction or minimal reduction in visual acuity. A massive intravitreal haemorrhage leads to a severe reduction in visual acuity, with visual acuity reduced to light perception at most.

The cause of the haemorrhage is easy to recognize when the retina remains visible. In other cases, massive haemorrhage renders the retina invisible on fundus examination. B ultrasound can then sometimes point to an aetiology, such as evidence of a retinal tear. B ultrasound is always indicated when the retina is not visible to rule out the presence of retinal detachment.

The main causes of intravitreal haemorrhage are as follows:

- Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
- Ischaemic occlusions of the central retinal vein or one of its branches
- Retinal tear: A retinal tear, whether or not complicated by retinal detachment, may result in intravitreal haemorrhage due to rupture of a retinal vessel.

- Allergy generally persistent throughout the patient's life
- Rarely associated with an allergy to other legumes
- Frequently associated with an allergy to nuts (walnuts, pistachios, cashews, hazelnuts)

The diagnosis of allergy to peanuts or nuts is based on:

- History (clinical history compatible with an immediate reaction)
- Food category survey (consumption of peanuts and/or nuts)
- Skin tests (pricks) with standardized extracts or, more often, with the native food. A negative test generally rules out an allergy
- Multi-allergen test (in primary care if no short-term allergic opinion is available), then specific IgE (peanut and nuts)
- A provocation test to provide proof, if necessary, that the suspected food is responsible (gold standard)

**Rubric:** Definition  

Unlike experimental studies, in observational studies, the nature and level of the exposure factors to which the subjects are subjected are not modified by the researcher.

There are three main types of observational survey design, which must be adapted to the study's objective.

== Cohort Survey ==  
Enables a sample of subjects to be followed over time:

- **Binary Judgement Criterion:** Not affected by the health phenomenon studied and records the number of new cases that appear over time.
- **Quantitative Endpoint:** Monitors changes in the endpoint (e.g., viral load, level of depression) known at inclusion.

**Objectives:**

- **Descriptive:** Estimate the frequency of disease occurrence, possibly comparing it with the incidence rate in the general population or other populations, or between periods, possibly standardizing on the distribution of sex and age.
- **Analytical:** Study the relationship between an exposure factor and the health phenomenon by comparing frequency indicators between groups of exposed and unexposed subjects using tests and measures of association.

**Methods of Recruitment:**

- **Cohort Study with a Cross-Sectional Starting Point:** Initial sample formed from the selection or random drawing of subjects at recruitment centers. Aims for representativeness of the target population.
- **Exposed/Unexposed Cohort Studies:** A particular form of cohort where exposed and unexposed subjects are selected separately.

**Follow-up After Inclusion:** Characterized by the follow-up of subjects since their inclusion to collect data:

- Occurrence of the event studied or changes in the level of the endpoint.
- Date of early exit from the study due to death, relocation, or lack of follow-up.

**Retrospective, Prospective, or Mixed Character:**

- **Prospective Cohort:** Inclusions start after the study protocol is finalized.
- **Retrospective Cohort (Historical):** Inclusions start before the study protocol is finalized. The initial sample is reconstituted retrospectively.
- **Mixed Cohort:** Combination of retrospective and prospective inclusion.

== Case-Control Study ==  
Involves the separate selection of two groups:

- **Cases:** Subjects suffering from the event under study.
- **Controls:** Subjects not affected by the event.

**Advantage:** Over-representing rare phenomena in the population. Including several controls per case can increase statistical power.

**Objectives:** Exclusively analytical, studying the relationship between the exposure factor and the phenomenon by comparing the prevalence of exposure in cases and controls using the odds ratio.

**Recruitment of Cases:**

- **Case-Incident:** Recruitment at diagnosis or event occurrence.
- **Prevalent-Case:** Recruitment regardless of how long ago the diagnosis was made, allowing faster recruitment.

**Recruitment of Controls:** Must be from the same population as cases, ideally eligible as cases if they had developed the health phenomenon. Often done in parallel with case recruitment.

**Collection of Exposures:** Always retrospective for both groups, covering the period before the survey starts.

== Cross-Sectional Survey ==  
Used to estimate qualitative indicators (prevalences, distributions) or quantitative indicators (averages, medians, variances) in a targeted population.

**Objectives:**

- **Descriptive:** Estimate indicator levels with a quantifiable margin of error. The only study type that estimates prevalences of a binary health phenomenon at the study time.
- **Analytical:** Study the relationship between the exposure factor and the phenomenon by estimating measures of association. Interpretation is limited due to the difficulty in establishing a chronological relationship.

**Recruitment Procedures:** Must be representative of the target population, independent of health status or exposure level. Random selection or consecutive inclusion are preferred methods.

**Information Collected:** Status of each subject regarding the phenomenon studied and exposure factors at inclusion.

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis

Doctors must inform patients of the possibility of prenatal screening for trisomy 21 (SD-307), which is covered by the health insurance scheme but is not compulsory.

Screening includes a combined 1st trimester test based on:

- Maternal age
- Nuchal translucency measurement in the 1st trimester
- Measurement of serum markers in the 1st trimester (PAPP-A, free beta-HCG)

The course of action varies according to the result of the combined test:

- If the risk is less than 1/1000, simple pregnancy monitoring is recommended.
- If the risk is between 1/51 and 1/1000, non-invasive prenatal screening is proposed (test on free foetal DNA circulating in maternal blood, DPNI):
  - If the DPNI is negative: continuation of the usual ultrasound monitoring of the pregnancy.
  - If the DPNI is positive: proposal of a foetal karyotype. The FISH test has a very good positive and negative predictive value, but does not allow a definite diagnosis of trisomy 21 to be made. Therefore, no termination of pregnancy will be carried out on the basis of a positive result from an NIPD test.
- If the risk is greater than or equal to 1/50, a foetal karyotype is proposed straight away. However, the woman may ask to undergo an INFP.

If it has not been possible to carry out screening in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, it is possible to propose the measurement of serum markers in the 2nd trimester (hCG, alpha-feto-protein, oestriol).",0.8181818181818182,13.390476190476189,False,True,0.7649013996124268,0.6266745726267496,a,False,5,1

  - Otoscopy

- **New-born babies (objective tests):**
  - Induced acoustic emissions (OEAP) or automated auditory evoked potentials. Note that AEO may miss hearing loss due to auditory neuropathy (false negative).

- **Outside the neonatal period (subjective tests except tympanometry):**
  - Ensure the child is calm and quiet, provide reassurance.
  - Calibrated sound sources (Moatti box, sensory baby test): Observe behavioral reaction to sound stimulation, acutropic reflex (from 6 months, turns head towards object) or investigative orientation. The younger the child, the greater the intensity of sound required to obtain a response. Clear responses at 70 dB indicate no bilateral deafness in infants.
  - Voice test: Response to first name (after 6 months), familiar words, picture book (after 2 years), voice audiometry (after 4 years).
  - Headphone tonal audiometry if the child cooperates and understands (after 4 years).
  - Tympanometry: Detects tubal obstruction or serous otitis.

## Definitions

- Pain associated with an alteration in nociception despite the absence of evidence of a tissue lesion activating the nociceptors or a disease or lesion affecting the somato-sensory system.
- This is a group of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome.
- The pathophysiology of this pain is less well known than for other injury mechanisms.
- The most well-documented hypothesis is that they depend mainly on an alteration in ""pain control and modulation systems,"" with a reduction in inhibitory mechanisms and/or an increase in facilitatory mechanisms.

## Nociplastic Pain Syndromes

- Fibromyalgia
- Irritable bowel syndrome (chronic abdominal pain - at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months - related to defecation, with changes in stool frequency or appearance; present for at least 6 months)
- Cystalgia with clear urine (urinary urgency)
- Temporomandibular joint syndrome
- Primary headaches
- Complex regional pain syndrome type I (algodystrophy)

## Explaining Nociplastic Pain to the Patient

- Explain to patients that it is a ""pain control defect or dysregulation,"" a central neurological disorder of the pain pathways, sometimes with an identified contributing factor (physical or psychological trauma), on a pre-existing genetic or psychological background.
- Patients should be informed that ""treatment should not be limited to medication,"" but should always combine a physical and psychological approach, whatever the cause or context.
- Once the diagnosis has been made, information should be provided in writing, and ""regular, gentle physical exercise"" should be recommended as a first-line treatment, particularly in cases of fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, and temporomandibular joint syndrome.

## Fibromyalgia

- Fibromyalgia (FM) is common (1.6% of the population) and affects women at least twice as often as men.
- It is the most frequent chronic diffuse pain pathology and one of the most common types of non-disciplinary pain (along with irritable bowel syndrome).
- Many pathologies can mimic and/or be associated with FM (RA, SpA, Lupus, osteoarthritis, small-fibre neuropathy, etc.).
- There are practical questionnaires for screening and diagnosing fibromyalgia, in particular the simple, validated FiRST questionnaire.

### ACR Criteria (Revised in 2016)

- Diffuse pain affecting at least 4 out of 5 areas of the body
- Symptoms for at least 3 months
- Diffuse Pain Index (DPI) (0-19) and Symptom Severity Scale (SS) (0-12): based on the presence and intensity of the following symptoms: fatigue (0-3), waking up without rest (0-3), cognitive impairment (0-3) and, in the last 6 months: headaches (0-1), abdominal pain/cramps (0-1) and depression (0-1).
- The diagnosis is made if the combination of IDD > 7 and SS > 5 or the combination of IDD between 4 and 6 and SS > 9.

### Associated Symptoms

- Frequent associated somatic symptoms: asthenia, sleep disorders, tension headaches, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, restless legs syndrome, urinary urgency.
- Frequent associated psychological and cognitive symptoms: anxiety and depressive disorders, post-traumatic stress, hypervigilance (excessive focus on pain), neuroticism (tendency to express negative emotions), feelings of injustice, inflexible coping strategies, catastrophism, concentration/attention and memory problems, etc.

### Complementary Examinations

- Must be limited: CBC platelets, CRP, Ionogram TSH, PTH, Vit D, autoantibodies if clinically indicated, no X-rays.

### Treatment

- Must be multimodal: provide the diagnosis and integrate multidisciplinary approaches with the patient's involvement, without giving false hope of magical results.

**Title:** Knowing the Pathophysiology of Contact Eczema

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Physiopathology

**Definitions**

Allergic contact dermatitis is an allergic hypersensitivity specific to a given antigen (called an ""allergen""). It is an adaptive inflammatory reaction mediated by CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells). It is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or type IV in the Gel and Coombs classification. The Type IV delayed hypersensitivity is illustrated in the Gel and Coombs classification.

**Pathophysiological Phases**

1. **Asymptomatic Sensitisation Phase:** In non-sensitised individuals, the allergen penetrates the epidermis and is picked up by skin dendritic cells, which migrate to the lymph nodes and present the allergen to naïve LTCD8+. The naïve LTCD8+ that recognise the allergen then differentiate into cytotoxic memory LTCD8+, which circulate throughout the body, particularly in the skin. This sensitisation phase is asymptomatic and may last from a few days to a few years. The onset of sensitisation is correlated with the duration of exposure and the concentration of the allergen.

2. **Symptomatic Phase (Allergic Contact Dermatitis):** When the skin comes into contact with the allergen again, the allergen-specific memory LTCD8+ react against the epithelial cells covered with allergen and trigger an inflammatory reaction. This is expressed clinically in the form of eczema and histologically in the form of an infiltrate of lymphocytes in the epidermis (exocytosis) and epidermal oedema (spongiosis). It takes 24 to 48 hours for contact eczema to appear after contact with the allergen in an already sensitised individual.

Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease transmitted by drinking water.

**Taeniasis**  
Taeniasis is a cestodosis, cosmopolitan for ""Taenia saginata"" and tropical for ""Taenia solium."" These flatworms release rings containing eggs in patients' feces. Humans become infected by ingesting eggs (fecal-oral transmission) or larvae contained in undercooked or uncooked meat from intermediate hosts (beef for ""T. saginata"" and pork for ""T. solium""). Ingestion of T. solium eggs leads to cysticercosis, which involves the migration of cysticerci into tissues, with the neurological form being serious. Ingestion of larvae leads to adult tapeworms in the digestive tract.

**Trichinellosis**  
Trichinellosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis, and humans are accidental hosts. Infection occurs by eating raw or undercooked meat contaminated with encysted larvae. Once ingested, the larvae travel to the striated muscles. Clinical symptoms typically include febrile polymyositis and facial edema. The course can be serious, even fatal, in the early phase of larval dissemination.

**Anisakidosis**  
Anisakiasis is a zoonosis of the cold seas. Humans are accidental hosts, contracting the disease by ingesting raw, marinated, or undercooked fish infested with larvae.

- Two out of three patients are not relieved by their treatment.
- More than 60% of patients admitted to emergency departments experience moderate to severe pain, and less than one in two receive analgesic treatment on admission.
- Almost 20% of patients who undergo surgery are left with painful after-effects.
- 45% of chronic pain patients take time off work for an average of more than 4 months a year.
- Chronic pain patients take five times more time off work compared to the general population.
- More than 70% of patients suffering from chronic pain experience psychosocial repercussions, including sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and cognitive problems.

**Title:** Know how to define and identify the clinical manifestations of acute complete or incomplete ischaemia.

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

**Definitions**

Acute ischaemia is the sudden interruption of arterial flow to a limb resulting in tissue ischaemia. It is an absolute therapeutic emergency, where any delay in starting appropriate treatment exposes the patient to the risk of amputation or even death.

The diagnosis is clinical. Complementary examinations have little place if they delay revascularisation.

The ultimate criterion of severity is paralysis. Palpation of the pulses allows the topography of the arterial occlusion to be determined. The image depicts the clinical presentation of acute ischaemia.

Acute ischaemia is said to be complete if there is sensory-motor damage. It is characterised by:

- Intense spontaneous pain in a limb, with a sudden or rapidly progressive onset, intense grinding pain, accompanied by functional impotence of the limb, poorly relieved by conventional analgesics.
- Limb colour abnormalities, such as pale, cold, livid, or even cadaveric appearance.
- Abolition of peripheral pulses downstream of the occlusion.

**Signs of Seriousness**

- Pain on palpation of muscle masses, indicating muscle ischaemia.
- Hypoanaesthesia, which rapidly gives way to cutaneous anaesthesia.
- Paralysis, with the inability to move the toes, indicating the severity of the condition.

This picture can be summed up in the ""6P semiology"" of the Anglo-Saxons: Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Perishing cold.

The absence of motor deficit defines incomplete ischaemia.

Complementary tests are of no help in making a positive diagnosis, which is exclusively clinical. They should not delay emergency treatment in a specialist hospital. The emergency is absolute when the acute ischaemia is complete, i.e., when there is a motor deficit.

Revascularisation must be carried out before the sixth hour following the onset of the clinical picture to reduce the ischaemic suffering time of the tissues and avoid neurological, muscular, or cutaneous sequelae.

Any delay in this management could lead to the development of an outdated form of ischaemia, characterised by the appearance of muscular rigidity, skin mottling, and phlyctenes, necessitating first-line amputation to avoid death.",0.6666666666666666,14.270000000000007,False,True,0.7664517760276794,0.5655678908030192,b,False,2,4

- Amniotic fluid (PLA) between 15 weeks of amenorrhoea and the end of pregnancy
- Exceptionally on foetal blood after 24 weeks of amenorrhoea

The risks are:

- Risk of foeto-placental discordance (1-2%) for CVS
- Risk of crop failure
- Risk of infection following sampling
- Risk of miscarriage estimated at 0.5% following CVS and 0.2% following PLA
- Risk of foetomaternal Rh(D) alloimmunisation in Rh(D) women; prophylaxis by injection of anti-D immunoglobulins should be considered

A clinico-biological examination is carried out prior to MAP to investigate and identify the causes of the couple's infertility. It is also used to assess the benefit-risk balance of MAP treatment for the individuals concerned.

It includes, as a minimum, the following examinations, following a medical history to look for specific risk factors:

- Clinical examination of both members of the couple if necessary
- Examination of the cycle and ovarian status
- Uterine and/or uterotubal examination as appropriate
- Spermogram, spermocytogram, sperm culture, and sperm survival migration test if appropriate
- Testicular ultrasound and even sperm excretory tract ultrasound if necessary, in the event of alterations in sperm parameters
- Health safety tests on both members of the couple or on the unmarried woman

For a detailed exploration of infertility, refer to the LISA sheet for item 38 (Couple's infertility, what to do at the first consultation).

""Health security tests"" include HBV, HCV, HIV, and syphilis serologies for both members of the couple or the unmarried woman. For people vaccinated against hepatitis B, a serological check is not necessary if immunity is known and documented.

The sperm survival migration test is indicated prior to MPA, in order to choose the most appropriate MPA technique. This test selects the most mobile spermatozoa and induces sperm capacitation. The result is an estimated number of progressively mobile spermatozoa ""usable"" for MPA.

A psycho-social assessment, involving an interview with a psychologist, may be offered to all couples undergoing MAP. An interview with a psychiatrist or a psychologist attached to the team is recommended (and systematically offered) for couples or unmarried women having recourse to gamete or embryo donation.

According to the recommendations of the WHO and various learned societies, an investigation of a couple presenting difficulties in procreating should be carried out in the absence of an active clinical pregnancy after one year of regular sexual intercourse without contraception. This assessment may be brought forward if the woman is over 35, if there are menstrual cycle disorders, or if there is a history of known genital pathology in the woman (e.g., endometriosis, risk factor for tubo-peritoneal pathology, gonadotoxic treatments) or in the man (e.g., cryptorchidism, testicular trauma, gonadotoxic treatments).

**Primary Assessment Aims:**

- Search for the cause(s) of female and male infertility
- Carry out a pre-conceptional assessment

**Assessment Components:**

- **Female:**
  - Hormone balance D2 to D5 (FSH, LH, E2, AMH)
  - Hormone test on D20: progesterone (only in women with normal cycle length) to be discussed
  - Pelvic ultrasound D2 to D5: Counting of antral follicles, exploration of uterine cavity and morphology
  - Hysterosalpingography D5-J9 (or tubal exploration by ultrasound with HyFoSy contrast medium)
  - TSH (target < 2.5 mUI/L preconceptionally)
  - Rubella and toxoplasmosis serology

**Title:** Knowing the major epidemiological trends in allergies to hymenoptera venoms: prevalence, mortality, etc.

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Epidemiology

**Definitions:**

Hymenoptera venoms (bees, wasps, hornets) contain:

- Vasoactive substances responsible for toxic reactions and non-allergic hypersensitivity.
- Enzymes and other proteins responsible for immediate immuno-allergic reactions mediated by venom allergen-specific IgE antibodies.

Bee stings occur mainly in spring and early summer, generally when the insect feels threatened. The sting remains in the skin, causing the bee's abdomen to rupture. The main allergen in the venom is phospholipase A2.

Wasps are more aggressive than bees and can sting for no apparent reason, sometimes several times because the sting does not stay in the skin. They sting until late autumn. Hyaluronidase, antigen 5, and phospholipase A1 are the three major allergens in the venom.

Hornets belong to the same family as wasps. Their stings are more painful, and the quantity of venom injected is greater. Allergic reactions are often crossed with wasp venom allergy (similar composition) and sometimes with bee venom (50% homology between phospholipase A2 from hornet venom and phospholipase A2 from bee venom).

**Prevalence of Hymenoptera Allergy:**

- 10 to 40% of the population is sensitized (not necessarily allergic; beekeepers, in particular, are very frequently sensitized and rarely allergic).
- 0.3 to 7.5% of the general population suffer systemic reactions, potentially causing severe anaphylaxis, with a low mortality rate (0.03 to 0.45/million population/year).",1.0,8.350000000000005,False,True,0.7670138478279114,0.6727584600448608,c,False,2,3

**Description:** Aside from intensive training: respiratory and orthopedic symptoms.

**Rubric:** Etiologies

As in adults, sport in children presents macrotraumatic risks (fractures, wounds, etc.) which are not specific to sport. However, intensive sport can also cause microtrauma, or ""overuse"" pathologies, linked to the repetition of sporting activities. This is the case for adults (tendinopathies, fatigue fractures, etc.) and children.

The main pathologies in children appear during growth peaks, at a time when the conjugation cartilages are particularly active. This pain around the growth plate is known as osteochondrosis, and is due to disturbances in ossification and is linked to the mechanical factors generated by sporting movements: tendon traction on the apophyseal cores, impact on the growth plate, shearing of the epiphyseal growth plates. The pubertal growth spurt, during which body mass and biomechanical leverage increase, is particularly at risk.

The two most frequent locations are:

- The posterior apophysis of the calcaneus (heel): Sever's disease. Appears most frequently around the age of 9-10.

- The apophyseal nucleus of the anterior tibial tuberosity (knee): Osgood-Schlatter disease. A common pathology in team sports (football, etc.), tennis, gymnastics, etc., most frequently appearing around the age of 13 in boys and 11 in girls.

These pathologies are diagnosed clinically, with the examination revealing mechanical pain localized in the growth plate. X-rays may be used to complete the assessment.

Treatment consists of a period of sports rest. Only the most severe cases require immobilization and offloading.

**Special Occupational Risks: Carcinogenic, Toxic for Reproduction, etc.**

- **Reinforced Individual Monitoring:**
  - **Prior to Assignment to the Workstation:** An aptitude medical examination by an occupational physician.
  - **At Least Every 4 Years:** A medical examination for fitness by an occupational physician.
  - **Intermediate Visit:** Nurse interview, possibly involving an occupational physician.
  
- **Out of Risk Workstation:**
  - **Prevention Information Visit:** Conducted on recruitment and periodically, at least every 5 years, involving a nurse interview.

Consultations carried out by the occupational physician as part of reinforced individual monitoring include a medical aptitude examination leading to the drafting of an aptitude sheet.

== Consultations Related to Work Stoppage ==

- **Resumption Visit:**
  - Mandatory after more than 60 days' absence from work.
  - Objective: To determine if working conditions need to be adapted.

- **Pre-Reinstatement Visit:**
  - Not compulsory.
  - Takes place while the employee is off work.
  - Purpose: To anticipate any difficulties upon return and to organize workstation adaptation with the employer.
  - Can be requested by:
    - The employee
    - The attending physician
    - The social security doctor
    - The occupational physician
  - Note: The employer cannot request this visit but must inform the employee of its possibility.

== Consultations at the Request of the Employee or Employer in the Event of a Problem ==

During all of these consultations, the occupational physician may make written recommendations to the employer on adapting the employee's workstation due to health conditions, while respecting medical confidentiality. Recommendations indicate necessary adaptations without providing a medical diagnosis.

Sometimes, the consultation results in the employee being declared unfit for work. This requires the employer to seek another position suited to the employee's remaining capabilities.

**Definitions**

Counterfeiting a medicine is the deliberate and fraudulent misrepresentation of a medicine:

- Its identity: name, composition, activity, or other details.
- And/or its source: manufacturer, country of manufacture, country of origin, marketing authorization holders, distribution stages.

It can be applied to:

- Specialties or generic products
- Products containing the correct ingredients/components, no active ingredient, an insufficient amount of active ingredient, or products whose packaging has been tampered with.

Dating from 1992, this World Health Organization (WHO) definition serves as a reference. The same definition was extended to counterfeit health products by the International Medicines Products Anti-Counterfeiting Task Force (IMPACT) in 2008.

**Not to be Confused With:**

- Patent infringement or patent litigation
- Unregistered products: medical products (generics or specialties) that are not authorized for sale in a given country but are authorized for sale elsewhere.
- Unintentionally inferior products: batches that do not meet standards, quality defects, or failure to comply with good manufacturing or distribution practices.

""Fake medicines"" have a broader definition to extend the scope of the WHO's fight against counterfeit medicines:

- Counterfeit medicines: the concept of intellectual property protection varies greatly from country to country.
- Patent infringement: requires chemical analysis of the product.
- Trademark infringement: e.g., imitation packaging.

The term ""counterfeiting,"" which is ambiguous, is therefore being abandoned.

Several texts have been adopted to strengthen this fight, including the Council of Europe Convention on counterfeiting of medical products and similar crimes threatening public health (known as Medicrime).",0.0,,False,False,0.868236780166626,0.664673646291097,b,True,2,3

**Title:** Managing Living Donors

**Section: Management**

The shortage of organs has gradually led to an expansion in the circle of living donors, governed by Bioethics laws.

Living donor transplants are primarily used for kidney transplants (15.2% in 2018) and, to a lesser extent, for liver transplants (1% in 2018).

**Advantages of Living Donor Kidney Transplants:**

- Enables transplants requiring specific preparation, such as ABO-incompatible transplants or desensitization of the recipient with an anti-HLA antibody against a donor's HLA antigen.
- Offers better long-term survival of the transplanted organ.
- Helps combat the shortage of transplants.
- Reduces the recipient's waiting time.
- Allows for pre-emptive transplants, performed before the recipient starts extra-renal purification.

The medical assessment of potential donors ensures no underlying pathologies and seeks to minimize risks to the donor.

**Protection of Future Donors:**

- The living donor committee authorizes or refuses the donation and ensures the donor's decision is voluntary.
- The President of the Judicial Court checks that consent is free, informed, and compliant with legal conditions.

**Definitions**

The Social Security Financing Act establishes the general conditions for the financial equilibrium of the social security system and, based on revenue forecasts, sets expenditure targets. It is passed each year by parliament following a government bill.

The Social Security Financing Act (LFSS) is a category of law created by the revision of the Constitution on 22 February 1996. It aims to control social and health spending. It determines the conditions necessary for the financial equilibrium of social security and sets expenditure targets based on revenue forecasts.

It should be emphasized that this is a financing law rather than a finance law, indicating that the LFSS is not of the same nature as the State's finance laws; in particular, they have no budgetary scope. Parliamentary control remains limited. Parliament does not have the power to set social security revenues itself. The LFSS does not authorize the collection of revenue; it merely forecasts it. Similarly, the expenditure targets voted by Parliament assess expenditure but do not limit it.

The LFSS is voted on by Parliament every year, at the same time as the Finance Act (LF) that determines the State budget. It must be submitted to the National Assembly by 15 October at the latest. Parliament must vote on it within 50 days; otherwise, the PLFSS may be adopted by ordinance. It may also be amended during the year by an amending LFSS.

Since 1996, Parliament has had a say in the financial equilibrium of the social security system. It can give its opinion on the broad outlines of health and social security policies, as well as on the way they are financed.

Examples of new measures include:
- Extending paternity leave from 14 days to 28 days and making it compulsory for 7 days.
- Increasing the salaries of hospital staff and those working in accommodation establishments for dependent elderly people (EHPAD).
- Funding expenditure on tests, vaccines, and masks to respond to the health crisis.
- Creating a 5th branch of social security to support independent living.",0.4,10.723333333333333,False,True,0.7900427579879761,0.6714270313580831,b,False,2,3

- **Cystitis (Lower Urinary Tract Infection):** An infection of the bladder reservoir and mucosa, which may be bacterial or mycotic in origin. It is by definition apyretic.

- **Pyelonephritis (Upper Urinary Tract Infection):** An infection of the renal pelvis (""pyelo"") and renal parenchyma (""nephritis"") of bacterial or mycotic origin.

- **Simple Urinary Tract Infections:** UTIs in patients with no anatomical or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. There is no general pathology such as immune deficiency. Diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 are risk factors for UTI but are not considered risk factors for complications. A UTI is considered ""at risk of complications"" when a risk factor is present.

- **Urinary Tract Infections at Risk of Complication:** Occur in patients with:
  - Anomaly of the urinary tree
  - Male gender
  - Pregnancy
  - Elderly (>75 years) or frail (>65 years with ≥3 Fried criteria: weight loss > 4.5 kg in 1 year, asthenia, self-assessment, walking speed < 0.8 m/s, loss of muscle strength, sedentary lifestyle)
  - Renal failure < 30 ml/min
  - Severe immunosuppression

- **Nosocomial Urinary Tract Infections:** Refer to guidelines for prevention (2C-004-PC-B08).

**Male Urinary Tract Infection (By Definition at Risk of Complications):**

- **Acute Prostatitis:** A bacterial or mycotic infection of the prostate, characterized by febrile urinary infection.
- **Cystitis-like Symptoms:** Lower urinary tract symptoms during the filling phase without fever. This entity is poorly defined and is treated similarly to prostatitis if the infectious origin is confirmed.

**Serious Infections Include:**

- UTI with severe sepsis (qSOFA score ≥ 2: arterial hypotension, high respiratory rate, altered consciousness)
- UTI with septic shock
- UTI requiring urinary tract drainage (excluding bladder catheterization). Severe acute obstructive pyelonephritis or febrile renal colic is noted in cases of pyelonephritis.

**Recurrent Cystitis:** Defined as cystitis occurring with a frequency of ≥ 4 episodes/year.

**Urinary Tract Infections in Children:**

- Distinction is made between non-febrile lower urinary tract infections (cystitis) and febrile upper urinary tract infections (pyelonephritis).
- Common infection in children: 1% before age 2, 11% before age 16.
- No distinction in severity between girls and boys, but prevalence differs: higher in boys before 6 months, higher in girls thereafter.

Prior to the 1975 Veil law, abortion was a punishable act, leading to imprisonment, and clandestine abortions resulted in the deaths of around 250 women each year. Penalizing abortion was intended to protect the country's demography. In 1972, Marie-Claire, a 17-year-old, went on trial for having had an abortion following a rape. This was the Bobigny trial. The young woman was defended by Gisèle Halimi, who won the case. The ""offense of abortion"" no longer existed. It was only three years later that Simone Veil, then Minister for Health, had the law decriminalizing abortion passed on 17 January 1975. In 1975, abortion was authorized up to the twelfth week of amenorrhea, and parental authorization was required for minors. The first abortion centers were opened in 1979. It was not until 2001 that abortion was authorized up to 14 weeks of amenorrhea.

Requirements for certain vitamins and micronutrients are also increased. Part of these needs is covered by the increase in food intake. Additionally, intestinal absorption of iron and calcium increases.

**Rubric:** Diagnosis

**Definitions:**

Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is the main complication of chronic and heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Its incidence in France is around 1 to 2 per 1000 in its complete form, and it is often under-diagnosed. This syndrome combines four elements, to varying degrees:

- Moderate intrauterine growth retardation
- Typical facial dysmorphia including:
  - Abnormalities of the upper lip (thinness) and philtrum (bulging)
  - Pronounced nasal bridge, short nose
  - Narrow palpebral fissures, epicanthus, and hypertelorism
  - Bilateral ptosis
  - Hypertrichosis with synophrisis
  - Cleared chin with retrognathism
  - Low and poorly hemmed ears
- Malformations: present in 10 to 30% of severe forms, mainly neurological (spina bifida, agenesis of corpus callosum, cerebellar anomalies, hydrocephalus, etc.), cardiac (mainly CIA and CIV), skeletal (scoliosis, radio-ulnar synostosis, clinodactyly, etc.), and facial (cleft lip and palate).
- Delayed acquisition, combining cognitive and behavioral problems of varying intensity. In the most severe forms, the delay in acquisition may be referred to as mental retardation and prevent the child from having a conventional education or even being independent (living in an institution). These disorders may appear even though there is no growth retardation or dysmorphia, particularly in cases where alcohol consumption is more moderate. In these cases, we prefer to use the term FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder) rather than FAS, which can occur at a rate of up to 5 per 1000 births. There may also be an isolated drop in intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioral problems such as aggression, hyperactivity, fine motor skills or tone disorders, and delayed acquisition of language and writing.

# VI. Symptomatic Treatment of Generalized Edema and Monitoring

## A. Treatment

- Treatment of the underlying cause
- Symptomatic treatment to induce a negative sodium balance

1. Restriction of sodium intake  
   - Salt-restricted diet providing 2 to 4 g NaCl (i.e., 35 to 70 mmoles of sodium)  
   - In the absence of hyponatremia (intracellular hyperhydration), there should be no restriction of water intake.

2. Increased elimination of sodium  
   - Henle loop diuretics have the most powerful natriuretic effect  
     - Furosemide and bumetanide are used in higher doses when renal function is impaired.  
     - The injectable form, particularly continuous infusion, allows greater natriuresis to be achieved when edema is major or resistant to oral treatment.  
     - The doses of furosemide used range from 20 to 500 mg per day orally or intravenously. The venous route allows the dosage of the diuretic to be titrated progressively and requires dosages 2 times lower.

- Distal-acting diuretics have a synergistic effect with loop diuretics:  
  - Spironolactone helps to avoid the hypokalemia induced by loop diuretics by having a synergistic effect on natriuresis. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment.  
  - Amiloride also has a synergistic effect with loop diuretics. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment.

- Thiazides have a synergistic effect on natriuresis. The combination of loop diuretic and hydrochlorothiazide is very effective, particularly in patients with cardiac insufficiency.

- Infusion of albumin or other products responsible for volemic expansion have very limited indications (ascites puncture in cirrhosis).

## B. Monitoring

1. Clinical  
   - Tolerance monitoring involves:  
     - Pulse, standing and lying blood pressure to look for orthostatic arterial hypotension.  
     - Weight loss should be limited to less than 1 kg/day in subjects at risk of developing functional renal failure, particularly the elderly, diabetic or nephrotic patients, and patients with chronic renal failure.

2. Biology  
   - 24-hour natriuresis increases in the first few days following the introduction or increase in dose of diuretics.  
   - The appearance of side effects will be monitored:  
     - Functional acute renal failure: measurement of blood urea and creatinine.  
     - Hemoconcentration: protidemia, hematocrit.  
     - Ionic disorders: kalaemia (+++), natremia.

Medical ethics encompass the duties of doctors towards patients, other professionals, and society. The Code of Medical Ethics serves as a reference for the jurisdictional bodies of the Ordre des Médecins.

**Definition**

The term ""deontology"" first appeared in French in 1825, in a translation of the work of the English utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham entitled ""Essai sur la nomenclature et la classification des principales branches d'Art et Science"".

In medicine, professional ethics serve as a reference for the legal bodies of the Ordre des Médecins and as a guide for doctors in their daily practice, in the service of patients.

The Code of Medical Ethics is not solely drafted by the profession. While the Ordre National des Médecins is responsible for drafting it, the text is submitted to the administration, the Conseil d'Etat, and the government for compliance checks with laws and regulations. Amendments may be made, and the code is published in the Journal Officiel under the Prime Minister's signature.

The Code of Ethics outlines the regulatory provisions governing professional practice. These provisions are subordinate to more important texts, such as the Constitution and laws, and must be compatible with other decrees. Doctors, like other citizens, are subject to the law, including respect for life and professional secrecy, but their professional body is governed by its own rules.

- Lower limb movements, step size, and speed
- Upper limb movements (e.g., symmetrical swing)
- Posture of the trunk and general gait when walking
- Occurrence of problems in specific circumstances (transfers, turning around, going up and down stairs, walking in tandem, or with eyes closed)

**Posture:**

Posture can be normal or inclined forwards, backwards, or sideways.

**Balance:**

Balance is tested with the eyes open and then closed, in bipodal support with the feet together or apart, in monopodal support, and during maneuvers of resistance to retro- or antepulsion.

**Neurological Examination:**

The examination must include a search for motor deficits, including a study of the osteotendinous and plantar cutaneous reflexes, a search for amyotrophy, sensory deficits, cerebellar syndrome, peripheral or central vestibular syndrome, Parkinsonian syndrome or movement disorders, vesico-sphincter disorders, and cognitive disorders.

The general scheme is based on a hierarchy of national, regional, and local bodies, structured by type of risk, managed jointly, and placed under the supervision of the Ministries responsible for social security (Ministry of Solidarity and Health and Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Recovery).

**Population Groups Covered**

When social security was created, the General Scheme covered salaried workers in the private sector. It has since expanded to include groups such as students, the unemployed, and government contract workers, who are not employed in the private sector. France aims to achieve universal coverage of the population, regardless of their contribution to the financing of social security.

The general scheme is currently the largest in terms of the number of people covered (nearly 30 million), including those covered for sickness, family, retirement, industrial accidents, and occupational diseases.

Since 2018, following the abolition of the Social Scheme for the Self-Employed (RSI), the general scheme has managed the social risks of the self-employed, including tradespeople, industrialists, shopkeepers, and non-regulated liberal professions.

**Organization**

Since the ""Jeanneney"" decree of 21 August 1967 on the administrative and financial organization of social security, the General Scheme has been divided into branches of activity headed by an autonomous national fund.

- The Family branch is managed by the Caisse nationale des allocations familiales (Cnaf). It supports families in their daily lives, childcare, access to housing, and the fight against poverty and disability.
  
- The Sickness, Occupational Injuries, and Occupational Risks branch is managed by the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM). It covers risks related to sickness, maternity, disability, death, accidents at work, and occupational diseases.

- The Old Age branch is managed by the Caisse nationale d'assurance vieillesse (CNAV). It pays basic retirement pensions.

Additionally, the laws of 7 August 2020 introduce a fifth branch of social security to cover the risk of loss of autonomy and disability. This new branch will be managed by the Caisse nationale de solidarité pour l'autonomie (CNSA).

Two other branches perform common, cross-functional tasks:

- The social security contribution collection branch is managed by the Urssaf Caisse nationale. It collects resources allocated to other branches of social security through local offices - the Urssaf.

- The Fédération des employeurs du Régime général de la Sécurité sociale is managed by the Union des caisses nationales de sécurité sociale (UCANSS). It handles social dialogue, shared human resources management tasks, and missions of common interest, such as property operations or sustainable development policies.

**Summary Diagram**

The general scheme will have four autonomous branches in 2021. The autonomy branch will be the fifth branch and is currently being set up.

Each branch is headed by a national fund (a public administrative body), which coordinates and manages a network of regional funds. The regional funds are private-law bodies responsible for providing a public service, subject to State control and supervision.",0.8333333333333334,12.775000000000002,False,True,0.7175319194793701,0.5714545448621114,b,False,4,3

The choice of study methodology depends on the objective being pursued. To assess the suitability of these methods, it is crucial to define this objective precisely:

- **Specify the Question Asked:**
  - The outcome criterion(s).
  - The exposure factor(s) studied, if any.
    - Risk factors in analytical studies (see ""Risk factor, etiological factor, prognostic factor, health determinants, exposure factor 2C-020-DE-A04"").
    - Experimental intervention in experimental studies.
  - The target population (see ""Target population and source, sample 2C-020-DE-A05"").

- **Specify the Approach:**
  - Observational: The nature and level of the exposure factors to which the subjects included in the study are subjected are not modified.
  - Experimental: Subjects are subjected to an experimental intervention which would not have taken place, or not under the same conditions, or not at the same time, if they had not been included in the study.

- **Specify the Aim of the Study:**
  - Descriptive Studies: Always observational, their aim is to describe the distribution or changes in the frequency of health events and their determinants in the population.
  - Explanatory Studies (Analytical Studies): Always observational, their aim is to identify the existence of an association between a risk factor and a health phenomenon.
  - Experimental Studies: The approach is experimental by definition. The exposure factor studied is an experimental intervention carried out for the study (controlled by the experimenter) whose effect on a health phenomenon is to be evaluated. When they are randomized, controlled, and correctly conducted, they have the highest level of evidence to establish a causal link between the exposure factor (drug, surgical or screening strategy, health promotion intervention, etc.) and the health phenomenon (death, recovery, relapse, onset of disease, etc.).

- Respect for autonomy (informed consent, right to information, right not to know)
- Non-maleficence ('primum non nocere': 'first, do no harm')
- Caring: improving a person's well-being
- Justice: equal access to resources

Other principles may include respect for human dignity, respect for integrity, and the notion of vulnerability.

Arbitrating between different principles when they conflict is at the heart of ethical reflection.

To illustrate some of the ethical issues involved in genetic counselling, consider the case of screening for trisomy 21. The trisomy 21 screening policy proposed in France has led some to view it as a eugenic policy. However, this screening is proposed rather than imposed, and at each stage of the process, the patient is given information so that she can decide not to continue with the screening procedure. Once the diagnosis has been made, she can choose to welcome a child with trisomy 21. The principle of patient autonomy is therefore preserved. In France, for various reasons ranging from material difficulties encountered by families (such as identification or accessibility of support adapted to the needs of the child and then the adult with trisomy 21) to societal pressure, around 90% of couples choose to request a medical termination of pregnancy.",0.5,,False,False,0.6744378805160522,0.9758206804593405,a,True,2,3

**Local Extension Assessment**

- Local extension assessment is based on mammography and ultrasound. It looks for additional lesions and axillary adenopathy.
- Apart from high-risk situations (BRCA 1 or 2 mutated patients), MRI is recommended in cases where the clinical, mammography, and ultrasound findings are inconsistent, or where it is difficult to assess tumour size or the number of lesions if conservative treatment is envisaged.

**Remote Extension Assessment**

- Preferred metastatic sites are bone, lung, liver, skin, distant adenopathy, and brain.
- Extension work-up to look for visceral or bone metastases is not systematic. It should not delay referral to a specialist centre, where a decision will be made if necessary (according to INCa recommendations, June 2020).
- Axillary exploration is carried out by analysis of the sentinel lymph node (1 to 4 lymph nodes) ""in the absence of lymph node invasion"" (clinical or histological) and ""breast lesion less than 5 cm"" preoperatively. If this is not the case (proven lymph node invasion or breast lesion of more than 5 cm), an axillary curage (removal of all the axillary lymph nodes) will be carried out intraoperatively. The sentinel lymph node technique significantly reduces the risk of complications associated with lymph node dissection (lymphoedema).
- An extension assessment is carried out when there are negative prognostic factors. For example, it should always be carried out in the case of lymph node invasion (clinical or histological) or a pre-operative lesion larger than 5 cm.
- In this case, the first intention work-up is based on one of the following two options:

**Title:** Detection of Addictive Behaviors and Associated Risk Factors During Pregnancy

**Rubric:** Diagnosis

Addictive behaviors must be identified during the various interviews carried out during pregnancy. The question of the use of medication, tobacco, alcohol, and illicit products must be asked. It is also important to identify the risk factors and lifestyle aspects that will lead to the discussion of addictive behaviors, to an understanding of how women who use drugs function, and to avoid, on the part of both carers and patients, the negative representations and fears that paralyze human relationships and encounters.

Elements of understanding can be found in:

- The mother's life story
- The history of the parental couple
- Maternal lifestyle
- Maternal health
- Maternal fears

Greater attention is needed to spot certain less visible situations.

In women who are often well integrated into society and belong to high socio-professional backgrounds, addictive behaviors insidiously take hold. This includes 'social' consumption of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, opioid drugs, benzodiazepines, etc., on festive evenings or even professional evenings, and, little by little, to cope with stress, combat fatigue, improve performance at work, etc. When pregnancy occurs, these women, who have never identified themselves as drug addicts and do not frequent specialized services, become aware of their addiction. They find themselves at a loss and experience their pregnancy alone and with guilt.

It is essential to identify them so that multidisciplinary care can be provided, and this is most often the responsibility of perinatal professionals.

**Rubric:** Definition

== Definition ==

The therapeutic hazard is distinguished from errors by its inevitability. It is an undesirable event, the cause of which is a compliant and error-free care action. It is linked to the realization of a risk inherent in the care provided. An example is the occurrence of a side effect of a correctly prescribed and administered medicine. 

Therapeutic hazard is defined as a medical accident (an unforeseen event causing damage with a certain causal link to the medical act), an iatrogenic condition (the care provided to the patient caused the damage), or a nosocomial infection (the infection appears after hospitalization and was absent on the day of admission) which occurred without any responsibility on the part of the healthcare professionals or the healthcare establishment. 

According to case law, the therapeutic hazard consists of ""the occurrence, through no fault of the practitioner, of an accidental risk inherent in the medical act and which could not be controlled.""

**Description:** Epidemiology (B), Prevention (A), Clinical Features (A), Particular Risk During Pregnancy (A), Fetopathy (B)  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

**Epidemiology:**  
- The rubella virus is an RNA virus, belonging to the Togaviridae family and the Rubivirus genus.  
- Human-to-human transmission occurs via the respiratory or transplacental route.  
- It is most often a benign infection (50% asymptomatic) but can be potentially severe during pregnancy (before 18 weeks of gestation) due to the risk of fetopathy.  

**Prevention:**  
- Vaccine prevention through MMR vaccination is compulsory for children under 2 years (two doses: 12 months then 16-18 months), with catch-up if not immune or if vaccination is incomplete, particularly for women of childbearing age outside pregnancy.  
- Mandatory declaration of cases.  
- No eviction from the community is required.  
- Avoid contact with non-immune pregnant women.  

**Clinical Features:**  
- Incubation period is 15-20 days.  
- Contagiousness lasts from 7 days before to 14 days after the rash.  
- There are 2 phases:  
  - Pre-eruptive (invasion): fever and nonspecific general signs.  
  - Eruptive: maculopapular exanthema with patches of healthy skin, paler than the measles rash, following the same kinetics (head to toe), fleeting, disappearing in 3 days. It is accompanied by moderate fever and inconstant lymphadenopathy, particularly in the retroauricular and posterior cervical regions.  

Complications are rare and include thrombocytopenia, joint damage (rare in children), and, more rarely, neurological damage. Treatment is symptomatic.  

**Risk During Pregnancy/Fetopathy/Congenital Rubella:**  
Transplacental passage of the virus during the first months of pregnancy (before 18 weeks' gestation) poses a risk of death in utero or congenital malformations, with risk being highest the earlier the pregnancy (70% to 100% risk if primary infection occurs before 11 weeks' gestation, up to 80% between 12 and 18 weeks' gestation).  

Viremia during embryogenesis can cause damage to the central nervous system, inner ear, eye, and cardiovascular system. Congenital rubella can result in growth retardation, sensory damage (deafness, eye damage), neurological damage (developmental delay, microcephaly), or even cardiac malformations.

**Rubric:** Definition

This information is sent to a risk management unit and to the healthcare risk management coordinator, a compulsory function in every health establishment.

The third major class of error detection involves active systems based on the analysis of files or electronic traces. Retrospective analysis of files is a time-consuming and labor-intensive system unless a computer search using a predefined program searching for keywords is organized.

Serious adverse events are analyzed either with:

- A neutral external viewpoint, provided by the risk management unit.
- A positive error culture is part of the patient safety culture. It is based on not blaming the person who made the mistake. The natural tendency is to consider that the person responsible is the last in the chain of people involved in a care process. However, most of the time, the causes are multiple and often latent, undetectable at first glance.

A non-blaming attitude, which must be shared by the head of the clinical department and hospital management, encourages the reporting of errors, their analysis, and the implementation of improvement measures to prevent the recurrence of such errors. The opposite attitude means that errors are hidden. Failure to analyze them in depth creates second victims. A second victim can be defined as: ""a carer who is involved in and traumatized by an unforeseen and unfavorable event for a patient and/or a medical error for which he or she often feels personally responsible, leading to a feeling of failure and calling into question his or her clinical experience and fundamental skills."" The consequences can be serious, even leading to suicide when the carer, the last link in the chain, is personally implicated.

Drawing up and complying with operating rules is one of the conditions for confidence in the healthcare risk management system. These rules can be set out in a charter, which specifies that reporting an error will not be penalized. Important elements of this charter include the following details:

- Objectivity is the rule. Reporting is based on facts that are not interpreted.
- Anonymity and confidentiality will be respected in the analysis that follows the reporting of the error or adverse event.
- To be effective, reporting must be exhaustive, identifying all the risks associated with hospital activity and preventing them from recurring.

Serious adverse events occurring in hospitals are usually identified using passive systems based on:

- Voluntary reporting by doctors and other healthcare professionals, even though the 2009 ""Hospital, Patient, Health and Territory"" law makes it compulsory.
- The desire of patients, their families, or close friends to explain the problems they have encountered or to obtain compensation for the harm they feel they have suffered.

When the ulnar artery is released, the hand recolours, which means that the superficial palmar arch is permeable, as are the digital arteries.

The same manoeuvre is performed by releasing the radial artery; if the hand recolours, this means that the deep palmar arch is permeable as well as the digital arteries.

All children with a serious life-threatening illness, whether life-limiting (no hope of cure, usual early death) or life-threatening (curative treatment possible but high risk of premature death).

Six groups were identified according to life-threatening or life-limiting pathology, including:

- Group 5: Newborns with very limited life expectancy.  
- Palliative care does not stop when the child dies. It includes support for the family's bereavement:  
- Group 6: Members of a family who have lost a child unexpectedly as a result of illness, a situation caused by an external cause or a loss during the perinatal period, e.g., trauma, stillbirths, abortions.

== Integrated, Non-Sequential Approach ==  
Early palliative care may be concomitant with any curative care. In all cases, it involves active management. It is the intensity and objective of the treatments that are discussed.

== Graduated Organisation ==  
For complex situations, frontline teams can call on regional pediatric palliative care resource teams (ERRSPP) or pediatric EMSP mobile palliative care teams, including at home.

== Triangulation: Child - Parents - Carers ==  
Integrate the coexistence of parental competence and vulnerability.

== Three Perinatal Situations ==  

**Antenatal**  

- Extreme prematurity at the limits of viability: high risk of mortality and morbidity, particularly neurological.  
  - <22SA and/or <500g: fetus (antenatal) / newborn (after birth) said to be non-viable.  
  - <24SA: Most French teams do not resuscitate.  
  - Between 24 and 26 weeks' gestation: on a case-by-case basis.  
  - The parents' wishes, informed of the severity of the prognosis, are an important factor in the decision.  

- Incurable and particularly serious genetic diseases and malformations.  
  - After antenatal diagnosis, if the parents wish to continue the pregnancy and do not request a medical termination of pregnancy (IMG). Uncertainty is often at its greatest. There is the possibility of fetal death in utero, death at birth, or a life of unpredictable duration, very short or prolonged over months or years with a severe disability. Thinking about all these possibilities at the same time: psychological violence for the parents.  
  - Information for parents, diagnostic reassessment at birth.  
  - When in doubt, intensive management of organ failure will be initiated. In some cases, resuscitation on standby and urgent collegial consultation are necessary.  

**Post-natal**  

- Neonatal resuscitation situations with therapeutic impasse or diagnosis of particularly serious neurological lesions (extreme prematurity or severe perinatal anoxia). The question arises of a decision to limit or stop treatment by collegial procedure in accordance with the Clayes-Leonetti law.  

== Palliative Care in the Delivery Room ==  
However short it may be, it is a time for living and not a time for waiting for death. Draw on the concepts developed by developmental care. Parents will be involved according to their wishes.

- Hetero-evaluation via the NFCS Neonatal Face Coding System, EDIN scales (Newborn Pain and Discomfort Scale).  
- Analgesic and/or sedative treatments in the event of symptoms: sucrose (sugar solution), morphine, midazolam (usually oral).

== In the Event of Death ==  
- Respect and propose rituals and memorial traces.  
- In the event of the death of a viable newborn (>22SA; weight >500g) who is still alive, there is a specific neonatal death certificate (D0-J28).

**Title:** Know the Mechanisms and Pathophysiological Consequences of MI, IA, RA, MR

**Mitral Insufficiency:** Its importance and clinical consequences depend on the size of the regurgitant orifice, the filling pressures of the LV, and the acute or chronic nature of the leak.

- **Mechanisms: Carpentier Classification:**
  - Type I: Closure in the plane of the annulus/normal valve movement: perforation, annular dilation, etc.
  - Type II: Closure of the leaflets beyond the plane of the annulus: prolapse, rupture of cordage, etc.
  - Type III: Closure of the leaflets downstream of the plane of the annulus towards the LV (tenting) with restriction of movement of the valve leaflets in systole for functional leaks, in systole and diastole for organic leaks: rheumatic, anorexigenic, etc.

- **Physiopathological Consequences:**
  - Acute MI: Sudden increase in preload and pressure in the slightly dilated OG, sudden post-capillary PAH with acute pulmonary oedema (APO).
  - Chronic MI: LV dilatation and hyperkinesia (Starling's law), reduction in afterload due to systolic ejection into the OG, dilatation of the OG, with delayed onset of PAH and clinical signs.

**Aortic Stenosis:** Classically slow progression, the most common valvulopathy in developed countries.

- **Mechanisms:** Degeneration with calcification and fibrosis of the valve leaflets impairing systolic ejection.

- **Physiopathological Consequences:**
  - Increase in afterload due to increase in LV-to-aorta gradient.
  - Adaptation of the left ventricle: concentric hypertrophy (LVH) without dilatation.
  - Relaxation disorder with diastolic heart failure and late impairment of contractility.
  - Functional coronary insufficiency.

**Aortic Insufficiency:** The severity of the leak depends on the size of the regurgitant orifice and the duration of diastole.

- **Mechanisms:** By anomaly of the aortic root or by damage to the valve.

- **Physiopathological Consequences:**
  - Acute AI:
    - Abrupt LV overload (volume + pressure) due to relative increase in afterload.
    - Sudden increase in preload and decrease in coronary flow.
  - Chronic AI:
    - LV dilatation due to volume overload associated with moderate LVH due to increase in systolic ejection volume (SEV).
    - Eventual fibrosis and LV dysfunction.
    - Increase in systolic BP, decrease in diastolic BP, arterial hyperpulsatility due to peripheral hyperflow.

**Mitral Re-Narrowing:** Valvulopathy which has become rare in industrialized countries because it is most often of rheumatic origin.

- **Mechanisms:** Commissural fusion plus lesions of the subvalvular apparatus and/or calcifications of the annulus impeding valve opening and narrowing the mitral orifice.

- **Physiopathological Consequences:**
  - Obstruction between the OG and the VG: Significant dilatation of the OG allowing pressure damping but resulting in a high risk of AF and thromboembolic complications.

It is important to warn patients that none of these techniques can guarantee a pregnancy.

In non-medical fertility preservation indications, only oocytes or sperm can be preserved (Bioethics Law 2021).

Prior to freezing, oocytes, spermatozoa, embryos, and germ tissue are packaged in tubes (germ tissue) or straws (oocytes, embryos, spermatozoa, and germ tissue) containing a cryoprotective medium. Frozen biological samples are stored in containers containing liquid nitrogen at -196°C.

**Female Fertility Preservation Techniques**

In pubescent girls and women, two techniques are possible:

- Freezing or storage of mature oocytes or embryos, which requires prior hormonal stimulation. As with IVF, the ovaries are stimulated with hormones, and an ultrasound-guided oocyte puncture is then performed vaginally. The mature oocytes recovered can either be frozen and stored at -196°C or used in fertilization for patients in couples who so wish, before freezing and storing the embryos.  
  - However, this oocyte or embryo freezing technique has several disadvantages:
    - It requires at least two weeks (stimulation and oocyte puncture): it is therefore not indicated in situations where potentially gonadotoxic treatment is required as a matter of extreme urgency.
    - It induces a supra-physiological increase in estradiol, which is potentially harmful in certain hormone-dependent diseases (e.g., hormone-dependent breast cancer).

- Freezing and storage of mature oocytes without prior hormonal stimulation. This is accompanied by prior in vitro maturation of immature oocytes. This involves puncturing the immature oocytes contained in the small antral follicles without injecting any hormone. The recovered oocytes are then matured ""in vitro"" in the laboratory for 24 to 48 hours. Only the oocytes that have matured are frozen or used for fertilization with a view to embryo freezing for patients in couples who so wish. This technique can be carried out as an emergency, regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle.

If the patient in a couple chooses to keep embryos, she will only be able to reuse them later as a couple and with the same living spouse (the embryo belongs to the couple whereas the oocyte belongs only to the patient).

It should be noted that the fertilization method for mature oocytes stored will necessarily be ICSI.

- Ovarian cortex freezing or preservation involves removing part of an ovary or an entire ovary, usually during laparoscopy. The cortex, containing the stock of primordial follicles, is isolated and then cut into fragments which are then frozen at -196°C. For reuse, the fragments of ovarian cortex are grafted onto either the remaining ovary or the peritoneum. Autografting has the advantage of restoring endogenous hormone secretion as well as fertility. It has proved its effectiveness in humans, with more than 130 children born worldwide up to 2021 after an ovarian cortex autograft (spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies induced by IVF). The major risk of this transplant is, in the case of malignant pathologies, the ""reintroduction of the initial disease"" through the tumor cells present in the ovarian fragments. To avoid this risk, other reuse procedures are being developed and are still in the field of research (in vitro follicular maturation in the laboratory using primordial follicles from the preserved ovarian cortex or alternative grafting procedures using previously isolated primordial ovarian follicles).

In addition, injections of GnRH agonists aimed at ""resting"" the ovaries (to protect the pool of primordial follicles from the effects of chemotherapy) may be proposed, even if this has not been shown to be effective.

In addition, it is possible to propose ovarian transposition during pelvic radiotherapy in order to limit the gonadotoxic effects of ionizing radiation on the ovary.

In prepubescent girls, ovarian cortex freezing or conservation will be the only possible preservation technique.

**Male Fertility Preservation Techniques**

- In pubescent adolescents and adult men, freezing or preserving ejaculated spermatozoa is the technique most often used (sperm collected by masturbation in the laboratory).
- In prepubertal boys, there are no spermatozoa present in the testicles, only germ stem cells. Freezing or preserving testicular tissue may therefore be proposed. The possible future use of frozen testicular tissue is currently still in the field of research, with regard to ""in vitro"" spermatogenesis, testicular tissue grafting, and germ cell transplantation.",0.5714285714285714,17.793333333333333,False,True,0.7845160961151123,0.6512245138486227,c,False,2,3

== Acute Complications of BPH Warrant Immediate Therapeutic Management ==

- **Acute Urinary Retention** must be suspected in the presence of hypogastric pain and an inability to micturate, along with the presence of a bladder globe on clinical examination. It requires urgent urine diversion through bladder catheterisation or suprapubic catheterisation. Alpha-blocker treatment should be started immediately. Failure to resume micturition after removal or clamping of the catheter warrants surgical management.

- **Urinary Tract Infection** may complicate BPH, presenting as acute prostatitis or orchi-epididymitis. It should be suspected with an exacerbation of SBAU, urinary burning, and fever. On examination, acute prostatitis presents with a painful rectum, while orchi-epididymitis shows as an inflamed and swollen area on examination of the external genitalia. Urinary infection is confirmed by ECBU and requires hospitalisation if poorly tolerated. Initial treatment involves a probabilistic antibiotic (quinolone), later adapted according to the antibiogram.

- **Macroscopic Haematuria** may complicate BPH. BPH can only be considered as a cause once other causes, such as urothelial carcinoma or kidney tumours, are ruled out. These should be investigated by uro CT scan and bladder fibroscopy. The presence of clots with urinary retention requires the insertion of a large-calibre dual-current bladder catheter for decalcification with lavage.

- **Acute Renal Failure** linked to the subvesical obstruction of BPH should be suspected with back pain, oedema, nausea, reduced diuresis, or anuria. Renal failure is confirmed by measuring creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate, and the cause is identified by renal-vesicoprostatic ultrasound. Initial treatment involves emergency urinary diversion with monitoring of the obstruction removal syndrome, followed by surgical management of the BPH.",0.8571428571428571,14.312857142857148,False,True,0.8450838923454285,0.6245917280515035,d,False,2,4

**Title:** Knowing the Profile of Memory Disorders in AD

**Description:** Episodic Memory Consolidation Disorder

Memory complaints are by far the most common symptom leading to the diagnosis of AD. It is a form of ""forgetfulness as you go along"" (for example, the patient repeats the same thing several times), reflecting an inability to form a lasting memory from an event experienced (Abnormal memory disorders/cognitive decline (SD-131)). It is not uncommon for the patient to minimize the complaint (anosognosia), while family and friends are concerned about it (Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders (SD-298)).

On neuropsychological assessment, the most characteristic memory impairment in AD is ""episodic memory consolidation disorder."" In the typical form of AD, episodic memory disorders predominate over other cognitive impairments, even in more advanced disease.

In verbal episodic memory tests (consisting of learning a list of words), the consolidation disorder is characterized by:

- No encoding difficulties (the patient can immediately recall the list of words).
- A collapse in the ability to recall words on a delayed basis (after a delay of a few minutes and an intercurrent cognitive challenge).
- Above all, the absence or weakness of the help provided by category clues (example of a clue, for the word ""truck"": ""what was the vehicle?""), with clues often causing ""intrusions"" (the patient evoking words that were not part of the original list); the absence of help from the clue distinguishes the consolidation disorder from a recovery disorder where the clue is sufficient to make the patient restore the missing words.

Consolidation disorder can be suspected by means of the ""five-word test,"" a simple test of verbal episodic memory that can be suggested in a medical consultation. It is proven by neuropsychological assessment by a neuropsychologist, using tests such as the 16-item ""free recall/indexed recall.""

This profile of memory impairment:

- As opposed to other types of memory deficits secondary to attention or executive function disorders, which impair the quality of encoding or retrieval of information (but not directly consolidation), as is the case in depression or anxiety, sleep disorders, excessive use of psychotropic drugs (see item 108 Knowing the main differential diagnoses of AD and item 132 Differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders).
- Results from damage to the Papez circuit, and in particular to hippocampal structures (cf item 108 Specify the principles of topographical reasoning when faced with a dementia syndrome).
- Is a good clinical argument in favor of AD (see item 132 Positive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease).
- Is not essential for diagnosis (there are atypical forms of AD).
- Is not pathognomonic (it can be observed in related diseases): additional clinical and paraclinical evidence is required to make the diagnosis of AD.",0.625,16.220000000000006,False,True,0.790837824344635,0.7244946956634521,b,False,2,4

**Visual Screening Procedures:**

- **At any age:**
  - External examination of the eye (eyelids, size and symmetry of the eyeballs, conjunctiva, cornea, iris (coloboma), pupils (leucocoria), etc.).

- **1st weeks of life:**
  - Examination using an ophthalmoscope or otoscope (coaxial light and orifice, non-glare light and observation from a distance of 30 to 50 cm).
  - Photomotor reflexes: organic cause.
  - Pupillary glare: leukocoria (EMERGENCY) retinal anomaly (retinoblastoma) or corneal anomaly (cataract).
  - Corneal reflections: strabismus.

  ""Leucocoria is a critical condition requiring immediate attention.""

- **2 to 4 months:**
  - Monocular and binocular fixation with a light source or high-contrast object, fixation must be centered (reflection in the center of the pupil), stable (no nystagmus), and maintained.
  - Ocular pursuit: with ""bull's eye"" (concentric black and white target), before the age of 2 months, movements are imperfectly coordinated; from 4 months, pursuit without head or body movement. May trigger nystagmus (ophthalmological opinion), if no pursuit = ophthalmological opinion to rule out bilateral amblyopia.

- **9 to 15 months:**
  - Look for amblyopia.
  - Alternating occlusion to look for a defense reaction (the infant ""defends"" itself when the healthy eye is hidden from it).
  - Spinning top sign: an object is moved to the right and left of the infant, if the amblyopic infant turns its head towards the ""sick"" side. Also used to test eye mobility.
  - Stereoscopic tests (relief vision): Lang test = dots on a plate depicting an object which the child tries to grasp if his stereoscopic vision is correct.

- **After 2 1/2 years:**
  - Near and distance visual acuity.
  - Object matching method (child points to or names the designated object): search for a refraction problem (Pigassou, Cadet, or Rossano Weiss test).

- **After the age of 4:**
  - Directional tests: e.g., Snellen's E-tests (capital E's of different sizes and with different orientations, the child indicates the orientation of the branches of the E either with an E-shaped object or with his hand (up, down, right, left)).
  - Number and letter tests (Cadet, Monoyer Scale).
  - Examination of color vision: Babydalton or Ishihara tests. Color vision should be assessed at least once on entering school.

Macroscopic hematuria is a major warning sign, but the etiological assessment can be carried out on an outpatient basis. Hospitalization is required if there are clinical or biological repercussions such as bladder or ureteral clotting, deglobulation, sepsis, or renal failure. Persistent hematuria can lead to chronic anemia.

Significant hemorrhage may cause clotting (fresh blood in the urinary tract) in the bladder and/or ureter. The appearance of visible clots and/or recent dysuria raises concerns about progression to Acute Urine Retention (Vesical Urine Retention 347), where hematuria and a bladder globe indicate bladder clotting. Lower back pain suggests renal colic due to ureteral clotting.

Clinically, a ""bladder globe"" and/or ""renal colic"" must be ruled out. The clinical signs (tachycardia, arterial hypotension, mottling leading to fears of hypovolemia requiring blood replenishment, additional sepsis due to urine stasis) and biological repercussions (anemia, additional hemostasis problems, renal failure, etc.) must be assessed.",0.75,,False,False,0.826964795589447,0.931017537911733,a,False,2,4

## Definitions

Lung opacity is a term generally reserved for chest radiography. It is characterized by a loss of normal radiolucency in the lung, which can take on very different forms depending on its size, morphology, contours, location, and whether it is more or less opaque, systematized, retractile, etc. A radiographic pulmonary opacity will correspond in CT to more precise semiological descriptors: nodule, mass, condensation, ground glass, etc.

The etiological range of pulmonary opacities is very broad. It covers diseases of the lung parenchyma, but also beyond, since pleural, parietal, or mediastinal abnormalities may be projected radiographically into the lung areas. Radiographic opacities can thus be categorized into syndromes: alveolar syndrome, interstitial syndrome, nodular syndrome, cavitary syndrome, bronchial syndrome, mediastinal syndrome, pleural syndrome, and parietal syndrome.

Examples of opacities visible in pulmonary projection on chest X-ray include:
- Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura
- Infectious pneumonia of the right middle and lower lobes
- Aneurysm of the aortic arch
- Pleural plaques in a patient exposed to asbestos

Among pulmonary opacities, a well-circumscribed round opacity (nodular syndrome) should suggest lung cancer until proven otherwise. However, this presentation is neither sensitive nor specific. In fact, the majority of pulmonary nodules (3mm-3cm) seen on CT are benign, and conversely, lung cancer may present as a mediastinal or hilar mass. Only histological examination can confirm malignancy.

Examples include:
- Lung nodule in right basal projection showing fatty content on CT, signaling benignity (pulmonary hamartochondroma)
- Right hilar mass found to be small cell bronchial carcinoma",0.5,17.793333333333333,False,True,0.8175974488258362,0.6222765644391378,b,False,3,3

Acute abnormalities are located on the ST segment and the T wave. They are associated with a myocardial territory (V1-V4: anteroseptoapical; DII, DIII, aVF: inferior; DI, aVL: high lateral and V5, V6: low lateral; V3R, V4R: right ventricle; V7 to V9: posterior). Classically, a distinction is made between two types:

- **Acute Coronary Syndrome with ST-Segment Elevation:**
  - ST elevation ≥ 2 mm in precordial and ≥ 1 mm in inferior and high lateral,
  - In at least 2 contiguous leads of the same coronary territory,
  - Usually associated mirror sub-shift,
  - A new left bundle branch block is considered equivalent to ST+ if associated with a suggestive acute presentation.

The SCA ST+ lower and lower lateral is an important consideration in diagnosis.

- **Acute Coronary Syndrome without ST-Segment Elevation (i.e., without persistent ST-segment elevation of more than 20 minutes):**
  - May show ST-segment sub-shift (more reliable if horizontal or descending),
  - Negative T waves,
  - Or a normal ECG, particularly when post-critical.

The SCA ST- is another critical diagnostic factor.

- **Aortic Dissection:**
  - ECG generally normal but may be ST+ if dissection extends to a coronary artery.

- **Pulmonary Embolism:**
  - Sinus tachycardia (>100/min),
  - S1Q3 appearance (S wave in DI and Q in DIII),
  - Right bundle branch block,
  - Negativation of T waves from V1 to V3 or even V4,
  - Note: ECG abnormalities may be absent.

Pulmonary embolism can present with sinus tachycardia and S1Q3 patterns.

- **Pericarditis with Tamponade:**
  - Diffuse ST segment elevation (not systematised to a coronary territory) and concave upward ST segment elevation, without mirror, without Q wave,
  - Sub-shift of the PQ then progression to diffuse negativation of the T waves,
  - Finally, normalisation of the ECG over several weeks,
  - Other anomalies suggestive of tamponade: microvoltage, electrical alternation (variation in the amplitude of the QRS, generally 1 in 2).

In tropical areas, ensure to drink treated (boiled) or mineral water and eat food that is cooked and hot, or washed and peeled if raw.

In the event of hospitalisation, additional contact precautions are necessary to avoid cross-transmission. Reinforced precautions (type 2) are required in the event of C. difficile infection. C. difficile spores are resistant to hydroalcoholic solutions, so hand washing with soap must precede the application of SHA in this situation.

Eviction from the community is indicated in cases of shigellosis, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, Salmonella Typhi, and Paratyphi.

**Vaccinations**  
- There is a specific anti-rotavirus vaccination for children before the age of 6 months (live oral vaccines with a 2- or 3-dose schedule; risk of acute intestinal intussusception is higher if administered after the age of 6 months). This vaccine is widely recommended in European countries, with an impact on severe forms of the disease and hospitalisations, even in older children (under 5 years old). However, it is not recommended in France in 2021. It may be prescribed but will not be reimbursed.

- Anti-typhoid vaccines: In 2021, two types of vaccines are available in France:
  - A monovalent Typhim<sup>R</sup> typhoid fever vaccine, composed of Vi capsular polyosides from a strain of Salmonella typhi, can be used in adults and children over 2 years of age. It is contraindicated in the event of allergy to one of the constituents.
  - Typhoid fever-Hepatitis A vaccine: This vaccine is composed of capsular polyosides Vi from a strain of Salmonella typhi and inactivated hepatitis A virus. It is contraindicated in the event of allergy to one of the components. It may be used in patients aged 16 and over.

For these two vaccines, seroprotection against typhoid decreases rapidly during the first year (around 40% of those vaccinated are protected after one year, outside endemic areas). A booster is indicated between 24 and 36 months after the first injection for Typhim<sup>R</sup> and after 36 months for Tyavax<sup>R</sup>, if protection against typhoid fever is still required. As far as hepatitis A is concerned, a booster can be given as early as one year after the first injection of Tyavax<sup>R</sup>, either with a hepatitis A vaccine or with Tyavax<sup>R</sup> depending on the risk of contamination.

Under the age of 2, none of these vaccines induces an effective immune response. As far as hepatitis A is concerned, a booster can be given in the first year of life, either with a hepatitis A vaccine or with Tyavax<sup>R</sup>, depending on the risk of acquiring typhoid.",0.75,18.990000000000006,False,True,0.6844309568405151,0.739488939444224,a,False,5,4

**Description:** None  

Complications associated with MAP are very rare.

**Complications associated with ovarian stimulation:**

- **Allergic risk:** Linked to taking medication; this is an exceptional risk.
- **Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome:** Main risk with variable severity. It is linked to an excessive ovarian response to stimulation, causing pelvic pain and bloating. This can lead to ascites or pleural effusion, with varying degrees of weight gain. Severe forms can be life-threatening, requiring intensive care. The main complication is the risk of arterial or venous thromboembolism, with phlebitis or pulmonary embolism suspected in the presence of chest pain or dyspnoea following puncture. Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) should be instituted in cases of proven ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. If pregnancy occurs during oocyte puncture, this thromboprophylaxis is usually maintained during the first trimester.
- **Adnexal torsion:** An exceptional risk linked to increased ovarian volume during stimulation, suspected with sudden, acute, lateral pelvic pain and pelvic defense. This is a surgical emergency.

**Complications associated with ovarian puncture:**

- **Risks associated with anaesthesia:** Common to all types of anaesthesia, whether local, sedation, or general.
- **Risks associated with ovarian puncture:** Extremely rare, including haemoperitoneum, pelvic infections (such as tubo-ovarian abscesses), and intestinal or urinary tract lesions.

**Complications related to the evolution of the pregnancy obtained:**

- The complications of pregnancy onset by MAP are similar to those of spontaneous pregnancies, including the risk of spontaneous miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Monitoring is identical to that of a natural pregnancy.
- **Risk of gravid venous thromboembolism:** Slightly greater when pregnancy occurs immediately after IVF-c or ICSI compared to spontaneous pregnancies or those after IUI.
- **Multiple pregnancies:** Slightly more frequent, depending on the number of embryos transferred (1 or 2) and the multi-follicular response to stimulation in the case of IUI. The risk of prematurity, caesarean section, low birth weight, and perinatal death is increased compared to a single pregnancy.

**Long-term complications of MAP:**

- **Transmission of a possible genetic abnormality:** Risks inherent in the male or female responsible for infertility.
- **Potential excess risk of certain congenital malformations:** Includes musculoskeletal, cardiac, urogenital, etc., and even cancer in the child in the case of IVF-c or ICSI techniques. These complications remain very rare. The question of whether this risk is linked to MAP procedures or intrinsic biological factors associated with the couple's infertility remains unresolved.

**Description:** Being a victim of discrimination (linked to sexuality, lifestyle choices, physical appearance, cultural origin, etc.) negatively impacts socio-economic integration and mental and physical health.  
**Rubric:** Definition  

**Discrimination Accentuates the Social Determinants of Health**

Social inequalities in health arise from historical processes of social and economic exclusion based on origins, religion, socio-economic status, gender, mental health status, sexual orientation, etc. The influence of living environment and social identity on the onset of disease creates a social gradient in health.

Health is socially determined: ""International relations and national policies determine the organization of society at national and local levels, creating social statuses and a hierarchy. Populations are organized according to income, education, employment, gender, ethnic origin, and other factors. The position of individuals on the social ladder influences the conditions in which they grow up, learn, live, work, and age, and their vulnerability to disease and its consequences."" (WHO, Commission on Social Determinants of Health).

For example, difficulties in accessing housing or employment, a polluted and noisy living environment, and experiences of exclusion or inequality can all contribute to a multiplier effect.

**Discrimination Increases Stress**

Experiencing discrimination contributes to stress, which can result in poorer cardiovascular health. According to a meta-analysis (Paradies 2015), people exposed to ethno-racial discrimination are in poorer health. This discrimination is a risk factor for depressive, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms, as well as suicidal behavior (Bardol et al. 2020). These experiences can accumulate and 'wear down' individuals (Wilkinson 2015). The accumulation of disadvantages has a corrosive dimension (Pelet, Charles, and Dergham 2020).

Discrimination can also make it difficult for professionals to practice, particularly due to the tension between ethical requirements and the reality on the ground.

**Discrimination as a Major Contributor to Non-Take-Up**

Non-take-up occurs when people affected by public policies do not use the benefits or services to which they are entitled. This is widespread, particularly in healthcare. Beyond factors like geographical distance, territorial disparities, and unequal health literacy, discrimination can directly contribute to non-take-up. Anticipating rejection, stigmatizing remarks, and financial barriers, people from vulnerable populations and/or economically precarious situations may avoid seeking professional help, delaying treatment or worsening their health. Some individuals face barriers that prevent them from accessing care and may no longer find their place in the social protection and healthcare system, rejecting the nature of the interactions it offers.",0.8,15.99857142857143,False,True,0.8559001684188843,0.6885069608688354,b,False,2,1

**Rubric:** Definition  

**Definitions**

""Survival data"" is a generic term used to describe the time until the occurrence of any event (e.g., death, relapse, appearance of a metastasis, hospital discharge, extubation, recovery). They reflect both the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of the event and the follow-up time of the subject, known as ""survival time."" They are also called ""censored variables"" because of their incomplete nature:

- If the event occurs, the survival time is the time after which the event occurs (e.g., the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and death).
- When the event is not observed during follow-up, there is ""censoring"": the survival time is then equal to the time during which the subject was observed (e.g., the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and the end of the study). If an individual is ""lost to view"" before the end of the study (e.g., following a move abroad), this is also considered as censoring. In these cases, the survival time of the subject is the time between inclusion in the study and the subject's last follow-up visit. It is not equal to the time until the occurrence of an event because it was not observed, but it provides information on the fact that during the entire follow-up period, the event did not occur for this subject.

Methodologies adapted to this incomplete nature are therefore needed to account for this censoring of survival time.

The Kaplan-Meier method can be used to estimate survival at each time t (probability of not experiencing the event before t) and can be represented graphically as a ""survival curve."" A survival curve starts at 1 (no subject has yet experienced the event at time 0, so the probability of survival at time 0 is 1) and then decreases over time as the event occurs for each subject in the sample (staircase). The vertical lines represent censures, i.e., the last visit of individuals lost to follow-up. The ""median survival,"" which is the time after which 50% of the individuals in the sample experienced the event (it may be unknown if less than 50% of the individuals experienced the event), is often used to describe the survival of a sample. In this example, it is 6 months.

The log-rank test is used to compare (univariate) the survival curves of two (or more) samples. The hazard ratio is an estimate of the instantaneous risk of the event occurring over time. It is interpreted as a relative risk. The value observed in a sample is always accompanied by its confidence interval. It can be estimated in a multivariate (adjusted) analysis, most often using a regression model known as the Cox model.",0.8333333333333334,13.080000000000002,False,True,0.7957050800323486,0.7128109137217203,b,True,4,3

**Definitions**  
The onset of puberty is hypothalamic, characterized by the reactivation of GnRH pulsatility (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone). GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone). This pulsatility is modulated by neuroendocrine and peripheral factors, including leptin produced by adipose tissue, genetic and ethnic factors, nutritional status, and intercurrent pathologies.

**Puberty in Boys**  
- FSH is responsible for the growth of testicular volume.  
- LH stimulates the production of testosterone, leading to the development of secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., penis, hair) and musculoskeletal changes.

**Puberty in Girls**  
- LH and FSH lead to ovarian activation and the production of oestrogens.  
- Oestrogens cause the development of mammary, uterovaginal, and external genital structures, followed by the onset of the first menstrual periods (menarche).

**Additional Factors**  
- Pubic hair development is linked to the production of gonadal and adrenal androgens.  
- The increase in sex hormones enhances the frequency and amplitude of growth hormone (GH) secretion peaks, accelerating the speed of statural growth (pubertal growth peak).",1.0,6.936363636363637,False,True,0.7108646631240845,0.7483418385187784,d,False,4,3

**Definitions**

No systematic complementary examination is indicated in a chronic constipated person consulting for the first time, in the absence of warning signs.

**Endoscopic Examination: Colonoscopy**

Colonoscopy with general anaesthetic should be offered in the following situations:

- If the symptoms appear or worsen after the age of 50.
- In the event of warning signs (rectal discharge, change in general condition, recent unexplained change in transit).
- In situations recommended as part of systematic screening for colon cancer in the general population (e.g., first-degree family history of colon cancer).

**Biological Tests**

There is no consensus, and no biological test is strictly necessary in the diagnosis of constipation. Their prescription will therefore be guided by the clinical context and especially if there are warning signs.

If a biological check-up is prescribed, it will include: blood count, C-reactive protein, TSH, blood glucose, creatinine, blood ionogram, blood calcium.

**Functional Examinations**

- **Colonic Transit Time Using Radio-Opaque Markers**: This examination is based on an unprepared abdomen X-ray after ingestion of radiopaque markers for 5 to 6 days to assess their number and distribution on the colonic frame. A formula is used to calculate the colonic transit time (normal is around 60 hours). This examination is simple and minimally invasive. However, it has low sensitivity and high inter- and intra-individual variability. It should be carried out after laxatives have been stopped.

- **Anorectal Manometry**: The aim of this examination is to identify a functional disorder of exoneration. Dyschezia, a clinical symptom, may show up in anorectal manometry as abdomino-perineal asynergy (or asynchronism), i.e., the absence of relaxation or even paradoxical contraction of the external anal sphincter when pushing. It is usually performed without prior preparation, in a conscious patient lying on their left side. The principle is to use a probe introduced via the anal route and topped by a balloon.

**Morphological Examinations**

- **Defecography**: The aim of this dynamic radiological examination is to look for an anatomical disorder causing dyschezia (problems with pelvic statics).

**Rubric:** Additional examinations

- **In practice:**
  - Any sudden headache should be investigated as an aneurysmal SAH.
  - Any progressive headache should be investigated as HTIC.
  - Any febrile headache should be investigated as meningitis.
  - Investigations are carried out in the emergency department, sometimes after the patient has been transferred to a center with the necessary imaging capabilities (angioscanner).

**1. Imaging for acute headache**  
- Request for an imaging examination (SD-231); reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination (SD-178); discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination (SD-226)

- **Cerebral CT scan as a matter of urgency:** Any sudden headache should be investigated by a cerebral CT scan without injection to look for a SAH, whenever possible with a cerebral angioscan immediately.
- **In the presence of a visible SAH:** The search for an aneurysm indicates a cerebral angioscanner if this has not already been done.
- **In the absence of a visible SAH:** LP is imperative.
- If no SAH is found on CT scan or LP, the search for another cause must be discussed (specialist opinion), particularly if the headache persists, and is based on arterial (SVCR), venous (TVC), and SAH (dissection) angioscanner, followed by cerebral MRI (TVC, pituitary necrosis).
  - **ASD angioscan** must be performed for any suspected dissection (cervicalgia, Claude-Bernard-Horner, sudden headache without visible ASD).
- Imaging will be repeated a few days later (MRI+MRA or angioscan) in cases of suspected CRS with normal initial parenchymal and arterial imaging.
- After an angioscan and LP showing no aneurysmal SAH, cerebral arteriography via the femoral route is not useful.

**2. Imaging for acute progressive headache**  
- Cerebral imaging is necessary in all cases, with a variable delay
  - Headache present or aggravated for < 7 days: emergency imaging.
  - Stable headache for > 7 days: delays to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
- A full brain MRI is ideally performed immediately (T1, FLAIR, injected T1, and vascular sequences) to look for an intracranial expansive process (mass, contrast) and signs of CVT. A T2* sequence may be requested to identify bleeding or a hyposignal CVT. A fat-sat sequence (fat saturation) and MRA of the ASD are required to detect a cervical arterial dissection.
- If access to MRI is limited, a brain scan without and then with injection of contrast medium and an angioscan of the ASD will be performed. If there is no diagnosis after the scan and the headache persists, an MRI scan should be performed to look for lesions that are not easily visible on the scan (CVT, PRES, pituitary necrosis, and intracranial hypotension).
- If imaging does not provide a definitive diagnosis and the headache persists, an LP should be discussed to look for meningitis or a CSF pressure disorder.

**3. Imaging for chronic headache (long-standing and habitual)**  
Carry out a cerebral MRI scan (avoid non-emergency scans as they can cause radiation) only if there is a suspicion of a secondary headache and/or a neurological disease that can cause auras (other than migraine).

- Migraine attacks starting after the age of 50
- Atypical migraine aura because of abrupt onset, duration > 60 minutes, symptoms always on the same side, or absence of visual disturbance
- Chronic migraine for less than a year
- Chronic tension headache for less than a year
- Algie vasculaire de la face (AVF) at least once (rule out AVF secondary to damage to the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, or posterior fossa)
- Abnormal clinical examination

**Paediatric particularities:**  
- Request for a patient's explanation of the procedure, risks, and expected benefits of an imaging examination (SD-232)
- The indication for brain imaging must be justified because: 
  - Brain MRI requires sedation or general anesthesia until the child is old enough to remain calm (7-8 years).
  - Radiation exposure in children must be kept to a minimum.
- The indications for emergency brain imaging are: abnormal neurological examination; changes in headache; signs of HTIC; visual or oculomotor disorders; persistent or increasing frequency of vomiting; signs suggestive of hypothalamic-pituitary damage; delay or change in height.",1.0,14.445454545454545,False,True,0.7914019823074341,0.7232096989949545,a,False,4,4

**Description:** Added today  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**

Hypersensitivity: Objective, reproducible symptoms, initiated by exposure to a defined stimulus, at doses tolerated by healthy individuals.

A distinction is made between allergic hypersensitivities (proven immunological mechanism, specific to an allergen) and non-allergic hypersensitivities (pharmacological or via direct stimulation of innate immunity).

**Atopy**

Hereditary predisposition to produce IgE antibodies in response to low doses of allergens. Atopy is considered a risk factor for developing immediate hypersensitivity symptoms (asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic urticaria).

**Awareness**

A term classically used in atopy, defined by the presence of an immediate positive skin test to an allergen, without prejudging any clinical reaction of an allergic type. This means that the body has developed specific IgE antibodies to the allergen in question. It is possible to be sensitized without being allergic (no clinical symptoms). In this case, tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.) are more effective than IgE and protect against clinical allergy. The skin test will be positive, IgE will be present in the patient, but there will be no allergy symptoms.

**Allergy**

Hypersensitivity reaction caused by adaptive immunity mechanisms: mediated by antibodies (most often IgE) or cells (most often T lymphocytes). Allergy corresponds to an imbalance between sensitization and tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.).

**Allergens**

Antigens that induce the synthesis of antibodies (most often IgE) or specific T lymphocytes, inducing an allergic hypersensitivity reaction.

- Pneumallergens: Airborne allergens that are inhaled (nose, bronchi) or come into contact with the eyes.
- Trophallergens: Food allergens involved in food allergy reactions.
- Occupational allergens: Allergens present in the workplace.

**Physiopathology of Allergic Hypersensitivities**

All allergic hypersensitivities have two phases:

- A phase of central sensitization in the lymph nodes, asymptomatic, which leads to the synthesis of antibodies (IgE in HS type 1, IgM or IgG in HS type 2 or 3) or the differentiation of allergen-specific T lymphocytes (HS type 4).
- Peripheral revelation phase (in tissues), symptomatic (clinical allergy) following new contact with the allergen.

**Types of Hypersensitivity**

1. **Type 1 Hypersensitivity or Immediate Hypersensitivity**
   - This is the most common allergic reaction (allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic urticaria, anaphylactic shock, etc.).
   - It is mediated by IgE antibodies specific to one (or more) allergens.
   - After their synthesis (sensitization phase), IgE antibodies bind to receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophilic cells.
   - During the revelatory phase, the allergen binds to IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils, activating these cells and leading to:
     - The release of stored mediators (histamine, proteases).
     - The synthesis of other inflammatory mediators from arachidonic acid (prostaglandins, leukotrienes).
     - The production of chemokines, which attract and activate inflammatory cells, and cytokines, which perpetuate inflammation.
   - These different mediators induce bronchoconstriction, vasodilatation, extravasation, and edema, which are responsible for the clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis.
   - Activation of the inflammatory cascade leads to the recruitment of immune cells to the site of the allergic reaction, which explains why symptoms persist even though allergenic contact has ceased.

2. **Type 2 Hypersensitivity or Antibody-Related Cytotoxicity Reaction**
   - Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognize an ""allergen carried by a target cell"".
   - Activation of complement or immune cells (NK cells, phagocytes, etc.) then leads to destruction of the target cell.
   - Example: Drug-induced cytopenia.

3. **Type 3 Hypersensitivity or Immune Complex Reaction**
   - Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognize a ""circulating allergen"".
   - Formation of circulating soluble antigen/antibody complexes (or ""circulating immune complexes"").
   - These complexes are deposited in tissues and cause lesions due to inflammation by activating the complement system and recruiting inflammatory cells.
   - Example: Hypersensitivity pneumonia, serum sickness.

4. **Type 4 Hypersensitivity or Delayed Hypersensitivity**
   - Reaction mediated by allergen-specific memory T lymphocytes (LT), differentiated during the sensitization phase. The memory T cells recognize the allergen during the revelation phase (new contact with the allergen) and trigger either a cytotoxic reaction (TCD8+ lymphocytes) or a granulomatous reaction (TCD4+ lymphocytes) 48-72 hours after this new contact.
   - For example: CD8+ LT in contact eczema and certain drug allergies, LTCD4+ in hypersensitivity pneumonia, epithelioid and giganto-cellular granuloma (e.g., pulmonary granulomatosis).",0.8,13.673333333333336,False,True,0.7374813556671143,0.6361055175463358,c,False,5,3

## Definitions

Atelectasis is a collapse of the lung parenchyma, affecting a segment, a lobe, or the entire lung.

Atelectasis is most often of bronchial origin, secondary to endo-luminal, mural, or extrinsic obstruction of a bronchus, usually of large diameter. It can also be passive (pulmonary collapse due to pleural effusion or ascension of the diaphragmatic dome) or due to coiling (secondary to pleural thickening).

Atelectasis of bronchial origin is manifested on chest X-ray by direct and indirect signs.

### Direct Sign

- Opacity corresponding to a retracted lung, with a reduction in volume of the affected area. This opacity is systematized with sharp edges. In lobar atelectasis, the shape of the opacity varies according to the lobe affected, but is most often triangular with a hilar apex.
- No aeriform bronchogram.

### Indirect Signs

- Scissural displacement, becoming concave towards the healthy parenchyma.
- Attraction of adjacent anatomical structures such as the trachea, heart, and hilum.
- Ascension of the homolateral diaphragmatic dome.
- Possible compensatory hyperinflation of adjacent territories.

Chest X-rays are frequently used to detect atelectasis of bronchial origin. A profile X-ray, in addition to a frontal X-ray, is often used to confirm and localize atelectasis. A thoracic CT scan is indicated to specify the site of the obstruction (endoluminal, wall, or extrinsic) and its nature (foreign body, tumor, etc.).

### Example of Parenchymal Atelectasis on Chest X-ray

1. **Figure 1**: Diffuse homogeneous opacity of the left lung field, without aeriform bronchogram, associated with left tracheal deviation and ascension of the left diaphragmatic dome on chest radiograph. Mediastinal deviation secondary to atelectasis of the left lung, with evidence of an endoluminal lesion of the left main bronchus on chest CT with contrast injection. Primary bronchial tumor.

2. **Figure 2**: Homogeneous systematized retrocardiac opacity of the left lower lobe on chest radiograph, roughly triangular in shape with hilar apex. Left deviation of the cardiac silhouette. Corresponding paravertebral opacity showing complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe.

3. **Figure 3**: Systematized homogeneous opacity of the right upper lobe with displacement of the small scissure, ascending. The scissure has a concave edge towards the healthy lung in its lateral portion and a more convex edge above the right lobe. This is atelectasis of the right upper lobe, secondary to the presence of a suprahelical mass. The suprahilar mass is responsible for the convex medial contour of the atelectasis. Illustration on the same radiograph of both the concave and convex appearance of the scissure, a consequence of the presence of a tumor mass: this is Golden's ""S"" sign.

**Title:** Distinguishing Functional Constipation from Organic and Congenital Causes  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

A distinction must be made between idiopathic or primary constipation and secondary constipation.

**A) Idiopathic Constipation:** This can be linked to two mechanisms: a slowdown in colonic transit (transit constipation) and/or a problem with rectal evacuation (distal constipation or dyschesia).

- **Transit Constipation:** Most often involves a reduction in the frequency and amplitude of colonic contractions. Patients typically describe a reduction in the number of weekly bowel movements, with dehydrated stools (small and hard because they remain in the colon longer).

- **Distal Constipation (Dyschesia):** May be due to:
  - A functional disorder (lack of anal sphincter relaxation or paradoxical contraction of the external anal sphincter during thrusting, disturbance of rectal sensitivity).
  - An anatomical disorder with a disturbance of pelvic statics (rectocele, descending perineum, internal rectal procidence, etc.).

In distal constipation, patients often describe exaggerated pushing efforts, a feeling of incomplete evacuation, and sometimes the need for digital maneuvers to encourage evacuation (most often in anatomical disorders).

**Note:** The two mechanisms of constipation can coexist.

**B) Secondary Constipation:** Indicative of an organic disease, digestive or extra-digestive, which should be investigated during the interview.

Any recent or recently aggravated constipation should be investigated for an organic cause, primarily colonic stenosis. A medicinal or toxic cause should be systematically sought in patients complaining of recent constipation.

**Warning Signs:**

- Changes in general condition, weight loss
- Nocturnal and insomniac pain
- Rectal bleeding, melena
- Severe, persistent constipation that does not respond to treatment or worsens without any obvious cause
- Rectal syndrome (epithelial discharge, tenesmus, false urination)
- Abdominal or rectal mass
- Biological indicators: anemia, inflammatory syndrome

**Possible Causes of Secondary Constipation:**

- **Digestive Causes:**
  - Luminal obstruction (colorectal or small bowel cancer)
  - Non-tumor stenosis (diverticular, inflammatory, ischemic)
  - Anal stenosis (anal canal cancer, inflammatory stenosis, scarring)
  - Extrinsic compression: benign or malignant tumor (e.g., ovary), peritoneal carcinomatosis, post-surgical adhesions, endometriosis, prolapse, etc.

- **Neurological Causes:**
  - Parkinson's disease
  - Multiple sclerosis
  - Spinal cord injury
  - Ponytail syndrome
  - Cerebrovascular accident

- Migraine is a neurovascular pathology linked to subtle neuronal and vascular alterations. The mechanisms are still incompletely understood.

- Migraines come in two varieties:
  - Migraine without aura (MSA): 6-10% of the population
  - Migraine with aura: The headache is preceded or accompanied by transient neurological symptoms (3-6% of the population).

- Migraine disease is a neurovascular pathology:
  - Polygenic hereditary: Multiple susceptibility genes induce cerebral hyperexcitability and dysfunction of cephalic nociception modulator centers.
  - Environmental factors: Pathology of adaptation to change includes internal or external triggers that disrupt cerebral homeostasis, such as changes to meals or sleep, unusual physical effort, climatic changes, catamenial period, stress, or positive or negative emotion.
  - Young people: 90% of attacks begin under the age of 40, and migraine is rare over the age of 65.
  - Predominantly female: After puberty, estrogen impregnation increases cerebral excitability, and variations during the cycle make attacks more likely. Migraines typically improve during pregnancy and after menopause.
  - Paroxysmal and cyclic with 5 phases: Prodrome, aura, headache, post-drome, and interictal phase.

- Prodromes: Activation of the hypothalamus can last up to 48 hours before the headache, leading to a lifting of inhibition of the brainstem and trigeminovascular system.

- Migraine aura: Wave of pervasive cortical depression (PCD) with moderate vasoconstriction.

- Migraine headache is caused by activation of the trigemino-vascular system and a major role for CGRP (calcitonin-gene related peptide) with perivascular and meningeal aseptic inflammation and moderate vasodilation.",1.0,14.080000000000002,False,True,0.7728811502456665,0.6530484755833944,b,False,2,4

Understanding the principles of comprehensive management of carcinomas involves specific treatment protocols for different types of skin cancer.

For Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), treatment consists of surgical excision with safety margins of 4 to 10 mm, based on clinical and histological prognostic criteria. Poor prognostic factors include location on the periorificial surface, size greater than 2 cm, sclerodermiform, and recurrent forms.

For Squamous Cell Carcinoma (EC), treatment consists of surgical excision with safety margins of 5 to 10 mm, depending on prognostic markers.

**Detailed Description of the Different Stages of Care:**

- Preliminary biopsy if diagnosis is uncertain or before complex surgical treatment
- Consultation to announce the diagnosis
- RCP presentation if carcinoma has a poor prognosis or is locally advanced
- Surgery and anatomopathological examination of the specimen:
  - Immediate surgical resection if diagnosis is highly probable
  - Simple suture removal, usually on an outpatient basis
  - If surgical excision is incomplete or ""borderline"": revision is essential

**Understanding the Principles of Comprehensive Melanoma Management**  
Following histological confirmation of melanoma, revision surgery should be carried out to achieve a complete and wide excision of the lesion with safety margins in healthy skin. The choice of margins is dictated by the Breslow index. The following margins are recommended:

- For intraepidermal melanomas: 0.5 cm margins
- If the Breslow index is less than or equal to 1 mm: margins of 1 cm
- If the Breslow index is between 1.01 and 2 mm: margins of 1 to 2 cm
- If the Breslow index is greater than 2 mm: 2 cm margins

For non-invasive Dubreuilh's melanoma, a margin of 1 cm is recommended.

Social protection is based on:

1. The payment of social benefits directly to individuals. These social benefits can be in cash with replacement income (daily allowances, retirement pensions) or in kind (reimbursement of expenses incurred such as healthcare costs or direct funding of services).

2. Access to social services provided free of charge or at reduced prices (e.g., crèches, canteen meals).

There are six categories of benefits corresponding to various risks:

- **Old Age-Survival Risk**
  - Old age is the most significant risk. It includes pensions, which are the largest part of this risk and social protection. It also covers care for dependency, not yet recognized as a separate risk, despite the introduction of the personalized autonomy allowance (APA) by the law of 20 July 2001, and the National Solidarity Fund for Autonomy, created by the law of 30 June 2004. Additionally, it includes benefits under the minimum old-age pension: the supplementary old-age allowance (ASV) and the solidarity allowance for the elderly (ASPA).
  - Survivors' risk covers needs arising from the death of a family member, usually the spouse.

- **Health Risk**
  - This includes illness, disability, accidents at work, and occupational diseases.

- **Maternity-Family Risk**
  - This includes daily maternity benefits, care for pregnant women, and various family benefits (family allowances, childcare subsidies).

- **Employment Risk**
  - This includes unemployment compensation, aid for vocational rehabilitation and reintegration, and early retirement.

- **Housing Risk**
  - This covers various subsidies paid to households to help them meet rent and loan repayments.

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

## Conducting a Pain Interview

- Diagnosis and assessment of pain intensity using a validated self-assessment scale (EVA, EN, EVS) must be actively undertaken by carers without waiting for the complaint. It is compulsory and must be recorded in the patient's file, regardless of the reason for hospitalization.
- It is an essential prerequisite for initiating treatment and can be carried out by any healthcare professional (medical students, doctors, psychologists, physiotherapists, nurses, midwives, dentists, pharmacists).
- Diagnosis and assessment of acute and chronic pain.

### Objectives

- **Screening and diagnosis of the nature of the patient's pain** (acute or chronic, neuropathic, nociceptive, nociplastic, visceral, mixed).
- Evaluate the location of the pain, whether it is diffuse or focal, radiating, its characteristics (type of pain, factors reducing or increasing the pain, etc.), associated symptoms and clinical signs (nausea, vomiting, fever, redness on inspection, tenderness on palpation of the abdomen, etc.).
- Assess the intensity of the pain by encouraging the patient to self-assess using validated scales (EN 0-10 oral or visual and VAS: pain intensity mild if <4, moderate between 4 and 6, severe if > 6, EVS in 5 descriptors).
- **Evaluate the efficacy, tolerance, and compliance with analgesic treatment** whether medicinal or not.
- The specific objectives of the interview and assessment differ depending on whether the pain is acute or chronic.
  - In the case of acute pain (often nociceptive, traumatic, or post-operative), the therapeutic objective is curative, and etiological treatment is possible. Assessment is generally limited to the pain area, pain intensity (rest, effort), consumption of analgesics, and sometimes associated anxiety.
  - In the case of chronic pain (a ""multi-dimensional"" entity with sensory, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral components), the objectives are symptomatic, and etiological treatment is rarely possible (HAS 1999 recommendations). Assessment takes time and can be spread over several consultations.
  - **It involves an etiological assessment with an interview, a clinical examination, and, if necessary, additional tests.**

## Tools and Scales for Assessing Pain

### General Principles

- Always use the same scale for the same patient unless there are changes in cognitive ability.
- If the patient has several painful sites, each pain must be assessed separately.

### Self-assessment Scales for Pain and Its Impact

- Aimed at **communicating** patients, i.e., children over the age of 6 or adults able to communicate verbally (no major cognitive disorders or disorders of consciousness).
- They mainly comprise ""pain intensity scales"" and ""multidimensional scales.""
- Intensity scales can be used to assess the intensity of pain at the present time or over the last 24 hours, and if necessary, to identify the 'emergency' to be treated, the level of painkillers to be used, the evolution of the pain, and the patient's level of relief.
- Multidimensional scales take into account different aspects of chronic pain and its repercussions. The most widely used is the McGill Pain Questionnaire, which explores the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. These scales should only be used in the management of chronic pain.
- The assessment of chronic pain can be supplemented by scales for depression, anxiety, quality of life, and sleep, which are not specific to pain. The most widely used scale is the Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), which assesses the anxiety and/or depression component in chronic pain patients.

### Pain Intensity Scales

- **The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS):** Generally takes the form of a 100 mm ruler, horizontal (adult) or vertical (child), with one end corresponding to ""no pain"" and the other to ""maximum imaginable pain."" The patient moves a cursor to the point where they feel the most pain, allowing the carer to determine the precise intensity of the pain (in cm or mm).
- **The Numerical Scale (EN):** Provides a numerical scoring system with or without visual support. Patients quantify the intensity of their pain from 0 to 10 at a given moment. Visual support can help in critical situations (pre-hospital, emergency, intensive care, post-interventional care room) or with less cooperative patients.
- **The Simple Verbal Scale (EVS):** Aimed at patients generally unable to use the previous scales. Includes qualifiers such as: no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, very severe pain. The EVS should not be simplified to the simple question ""are you in pain?""

### Pain Hetero-assessment Scales

- Aimed at patients with **verbal communication disorders**.
- Require the clinician to observe the patient's pain behavior and quantify it using a validated score: these scales are also known as behavioral scales. Each type of population (young children, post-operative young children, non-communicative elderly people, confused or sedated adult patients) has its own behavioral scales, validated in each typical population.
- Areas of behavioral observation most frequently included in these scales are:
  - Facial expression (mimicry, grimace) and crying.
  - Vocalization or verbalization of pain.
- Each hetero-evaluation scale has a threshold score associated with pain of significant intensity. These thresholds mean that clinicians must consider finding the cause of the pain and treating it.",1.0,10.941428571428574,False,True,0.7859187126159668,0.6611112554868063,b,False,3,2

== Menopause ==

Menopause is defined as a permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from a loss of ovarian follicular activity (WHO 1996 definition).

The definition of menopause is primarily retrospective, based on a period of consecutive amenorrhoea of 12 months with no obvious physiological or pathological cause in a woman over the age of 45, associated with suggestive clinical signs such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, and night sweats.

== Perimenopause ==

Perimenopause includes the period before the onset of menopause, before the period of one year of amenorrhoea. During this period, the main symptoms are disorders of the cycle and flushing, which may be present.

Biological assays are of no use in diagnosing menopause or perimenopause except in special cases (FSH and plasma estradiol assays).",1.0,14.111428571428572,False,True,0.7935763001441956,0.6646398107210795,a,False,5,4

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

The infection transmission chain illustrates how infectious diseases spread.

The transmission of an infectious disease results from the interaction between:

- **An infectious agent**: Characterized by its pathogenicity (ability to cause disease), virulence (ability to develop and/or secrete toxins in an organism), inoculum (infectious load introduced into the organism: number of viable bacteria, viral particles, etc.), its resistance to anti-infectives, etc.
- **A reservoir**: The ecological location where the infectious agent usually lives and multiplies, which may include humans.
- **A vector**: Animate or inanimate carrier of the infectious agent.
- **A source**: Unusual place where the infectious agent multiplies (e.g., a hot water system for Legionella pneumophila).
- **A host**: An individual characterized by susceptibility (immunity, skin lesions, or other entry points) or risk behavior (risky sexual practices, injectable drug use, certain leisure activities such as hunting - tularemia, fishing - leptospirosis), leading to the development of an infection or colonization by the infectious agent.

For ""strict pathogens"" (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, hemorrhagic fever viruses), interaction with the host always leads to infection rather than simple colonization.

In other cases, the interaction between an infectious agent and a host may result in ""colonization"" that is tolerated by the host. This agent may be part of the host's usual flora (commensal flora) or not (opportunistic agent). The transition from colonization to infection results from a disruption in the balance between the infectious agent and the host due to an alteration in the host's local defenses (cutaneous invasion or mucosal alteration) or general immune defenses, such as opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients.

An infection is said to be endogenous when the reservoir is the microbiota (all commensal microorganisms hosted in the skin, mucous membranes, and digestive tract).

An infection is said to be exogenous when the reservoir of infectious agents is located outside the infected host. The reservoir can then be:

- **Human**: This is the most common situation. A person infected or colonized by an infectious agent (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria meningitidis) transmits it to other individuals.
- **Animal**: The infectious disease is then a zoonosis (e.g., non-typical salmonellosis, listeriosis).
- **Environmental**: The reservoir is soil (telluric germ, e.g., tetanus), air (e.g., aspergillosis), or water (aquatic germ, e.g., legionellosis).",1.0,,False,False,0.6939390897750854,0.7301448186238607,c,False,4,4

## Epidemiology of Cutaneous Carcinomas

The incidence of cutaneous carcinomas is increasing. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer and the most common of all cancers, with an incidence of around 150 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year in France. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is rarer, with 30 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year. SCC is 2 to 3 times more common in men than in women.

The risk of developing carcinoma is higher in individuals with a light phototype (I and II), and the incidence increases with age. Sun exposure is the main factor promoting carcinomas, including both chronic and cumulative exposure (EC and BCC) and intense, intermittent sun exposure (BCC). Immunosuppression (e.g., organ transplants, chronic hematological diseases, HIV infection) is also a risk factor for skin carcinomas. Carcinomas primarily develop in areas exposed to light, particularly the face and back of the hands.

The phototype corresponds to an individual's ability to interact with the sun. Six phototypes are defined according to eye color, hair color, the presence of ephelides (freckles), sensitivity to sunburn, and the ability to tan (Fitzpatrick phototype classification).

## Incidence of Melanoma

The incidence of melanoma varies worldwide depending on the phototype of the population and UV exposure (latitude). In France, it is 15 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year and has been rising for several decades.

### Main Risk Factors for Developing Melanoma:

- Light phototype (blond or redhead, ephelides, light eyes)
- High number of nevi (>50)
- High number of atypical nevi (>10)
- Personal history of melanoma
- Family history of melanoma (10% of melanomas occur in a family context)
- Sunburn in childhood or sudden, intense exposure to the sun

In the majority of cases (80%), melanoma appears de novo and not on a pre-existing nevus or precursor.

### Phototype and Reaction to the Sun:

- **I**: Tanning = 0, Sunburn = systematic, Very fair complexion, Light eyes, Blonde or red hair, Numerous ephelides
- **II**: Tanning = +/- (with difficulty), Sunburn = often, Very fair complexion, Blonde or chestnut hair, UV-induced ephelides
- **III**: Tanning = gradual, Sunburn = sometimes, Light complexion, Brown eyes, Blonde or chestnut hair
- **IV**: Tanning = easy, Sunburn = little, Matt complexion, Brown or chestnut hair, Dark eyes
- **V**: Tanning = very easy, Sunburn = exceptional, Dark skin, Dark hair, Dark eyes

Iatrogenic parkinsonian syndrome, which may be characterized by tremor, is most often due to neuroleptics (antipsychotics) or hidden neuroleptics. This justifies systematic research into the use of these drugs when there is suspicion of an adverse drug reaction (SD-348).

The exaggeration of a physiological tremor may result from several drugs, including amiodarone, amytriptyline, antidepressants, salbutamol, theophylline, tacrolimus, interferon, and ciclosporin.

There is always a suspicion of an adverse reaction to medication (SD-348) in cases of chorea. Drugs such as L-dopa and dopaminergic agonists (responsible for peak dose dyskinesias, also known as mid-dose dyskinesias), antipsychotics, antiepileptics, lithium, calcium channel blockers, cocaine, amphetamines, or toxic drugs like carbon monoxide can be involved.

In the presence of dystonia, a systematic search should be made for the use of antipsychotics, sometimes hidden.

**Rubric:** Etiologies  

**Epidemiology:**  

- The measles virus is an RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family and the Morbillivirus genus.  
- Human-to-human transmission occurs by air (aerosol) and is highly contagious (R<sub>0</sub> = 15 to 20, meaning one infected person can cause 15 to 20 secondary cases).  
- It is a major cause of infant mortality worldwide, though death is rare in high-income countries.  
- Regular outbreaks of epidemics occur in France.  

**Prevention:**  

- Vaccine prevention through MMR vaccination is compulsory for children under 2 years (at 12 and 16-18 months), with catch-up vaccination if not immune or incomplete for those born after 1980 (2 doses).  
- Around a case, community eviction is recommended 5 days after the start of the rash.  
- Mandatory declaration is required.  

**Clinical Features:**  

- Incubation period is 10-12 days.  
- Contagiousness spans from 5 days before to 5 days after the rash, which is important for case investigation.  
- The disease progresses in two phases:  
  - Invasion (preceding eruption by 2 to 4 days): fever, oculorespiratory catarrh, and Koplik spots (inconstant).  
  - Eruptive (5-6 days): maculopapular rash with intervals of healthy skin, spreading from top to bottom (starts behind the ear, then face, then rest of the body).  

**Complications:**  

- Linked to the virus:  
  - Viral pneumonia  
  - Early acute encephalitis  
  - Late-onset encephalitis (up to 10 years after measles), known as Van Bogaert's subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  

- Linked to bacterial superinfection (persistence or recurrence of fever):  
  - Acute otitis media  
  - Bacterial pneumonia  

- Increased risk of complications before 1 year of age.  

**Signs of Seriousness:**  

- Linked to infection:  
  - Respiratory distress due to lung damage  
  - Neurological issues such as consciousness disorders and convulsions linked to encephalitis  

- Related to impact:  
  - Risk of dehydration in infants  

**Treatment:**  

- Symptomatic treatment  
- Antibiotics if bacterial superinfection is present  

**Case Management Around a Case (CAT):**  

- **Adults:**  
  - Check status: disease or vaccine. Vaccination within 3 days if not immune or incomplete vaccination according to recommendations (2 doses if born after 1980 or if healthcare or early childhood staff regardless of date of birth).  

- **Pregnant Women or Immunosuppressed Individuals:**  
  - Vaccination is contraindicated. Administer IV polyvalent immunoglobulin (200 mg/kg) if non-immune, and perform emergency serology if in doubt.  

- **Children:**

    - If the mother is immune: no action needed (baby protected by maternal antibodies).  
    - If the mother is not immune: administer IVIG within 6 days of contact (then wait 9 months before starting vaccination).  

  - **6 to 11 months:**  
    - If seen within 3 days: administer vaccination (this does not count in the calendar, so repeat doses according to the calendar at 12 and 16-18 months).

=== Antibiotic Treatment ===

Before any antibiotic treatment, an ECBU (urine culture) must be carried out.

In the event of fever in a child with signs of urinary tract infection (clinical signs, positive urine dipstick), probabilistic antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible after an ECBU has been performed. This is to eradicate the infection, prevent bacteraemia, improve clinical condition, and reduce the risk of renal damage during the acute phase of the infection and the risk of renal scarring.

- **IV Treatment Followed by PO:**
  - In case of complication factors and/or age < 3 months and/or doubt about compliance with oral treatment:
    - Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime or amikacin followed by oral retreatment.
  - In the event of signs of severity:
    - Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime + amikacin.
  - Followed by PO after 2 to 4 days, depending on the results of the antibiogram and once apyrexia has been achieved, by treatment with cefixime or cotrimoxazole (after 1 month) for 10 to 14 days.

- **Initial Oral Treatment with Cefixime:**
  - After 3 months, in the absence of risk factors or signs of severity and if home monitoring is possible and appropriate.
  - To be adapted to the antibiogram, followed by cotrimoxazole if sensitive, to avoid prolonged use of oral C3G with a high potential for selecting resistant bacteria.

In case of G+ cocci on direct examination: suspect enterococcus, and choose amoxicillin (in combination with gentamicin in case of sepsis).

=== Hospitalisation Criteria ===

- Age < 3 months
- Signs of severity
- Difficult to monitor at home

== Cystitis ==

Initial treatment of lower urinary tract infections or cystitis in children involves oral outpatient treatment with cefixime, cotrimoxazole, or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, followed by adjustment according to the results of the ECBU.

- Duration: 3 to 5 days
- Look for factors that may contribute to the disease

== Follow-Up, Complications, and Uropathy Research ==

- **Complications of ANP:**
  - Short-term: abscess, sepsis
  - Long-term: risk of hypertension if multiple, untreated, or delayed ANP (renal scarring)

- **Look for Uropathy:**
  - ANP is favored by vesico-ureteral reflux, which may be functional or malformative (uropathy).
    - Systematic ultrasound at first episode
    - Retrograde cystography if abnormal echo or recurrent ANP (apart from favoring factors such as bladder instability).
  - Beware of posterior urethral valves in infant boys, which is a medical-surgical emergency. Be aware of abnormalities on ultrasound (struggling bladder, dilated urinary tract), abnormal renal function, abnormal micturition stream, etc.
  - Examine the sacral region carefully and check that the neurological examination is normal (spinal cord abnormality).

- **Follow-Up:**
  - For ANP: ensure apyrexia. If fever persists, suspect a complication (abscess), check compliance if oral treatment, check sensitivity to antibiotic susceptibility test.
  - For cystitis: look for contributing factors in the event of recurrence, in particular constipation, unstable bladder, etc.
  - Nephrological or uropaediatric opinion if:
    - Voiding abnormalities (pollakiuria, leakage, poor stream in male infants = urethral valves)
    - Repeated infections

Human beings are fallible, and it is in their nature to make mistakes. Acknowledging that we can make mistakes is a prerequisite for adopting error-prevention behavior. Recognizing that we have made a mistake is an opportunity to learn and progress. This is true for individuals and organizations. When an organization implements systems for identifying, analyzing, and preventing errors, it is referred to as a ""learning organization.""

An error of omission occurs when a necessary action has not been taken. An error by commission refers to an action that was carried out but was not useful. An error of execution refers to an action that was poorly carried out.

A violation (or non-compliance) occurs when a recommendation or professional rule is not respected. This non-compliance may be routine (a bad habit), the result of personal prioritization (to save time, for example), or induced by the context (over-activity, urgency, etc.).

Errors in care may relate to preventive, diagnostic, or treatment actions. They may or may not have resulted in harm to the patient. They are unintentional and avoidable. A serious adverse event (SAE) occurs when the harm is a death, a serious complication, or, at the very least, a one-day stay in the hospital.

**Title:** Identifying an abnormal mediastinal image in infants and children and prescribing a thoracic CT scan  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

Abnormalities of the mediastinum in children are generally mass syndromes which may correspond to multiple causes (malformative, vascular, infectious, benign or malignant tumors). The diagnostic approach takes into account the age of the child and the topography of the lesion on the frontal thoracic X-ray, the first-line examination. If there is any doubt on the X-ray, ultrasound is the first test to be carried out in babies and young children. CT scans and MRIs are second-line examinations, mainly for tumor pathology or in older children. The younger the child, the more MRI is preferred to CT for reasons of radiation exposure. In infants, the most common lesions are malformations (bronchogenic cyst, esophageal duplication, etc.), neuroblastomas, and teratomas. In older children (over the age of 7), the most common lesions are hematological malignancies (lymphoma, leukemia).

**Identification of an Abnormal Mediastinal Image**

Reading the frontal radiograph involves locating the abnormality and identifying its topography (anterior, middle, or posterior mediastinum), which involves analyzing the contours and lines of the mediastinum. Mediastinal reflection lines are formed when the X-ray is tangent to the interface between two media of different density. The mediastinal reflection lines include paratracheal lines, posterior mediastinal line, anterior mediastinal line, para-azygo-esophageal line, paravertebral lines, and para-aortic line.

In general, a mediastinal mass present on radiography has:

- Clear external contours
- Internal contours that are not visible (because they are embedded in the normal mediastinal opacity)
- Obtuse connection angles (gently sloping) with the mediastinal opacity

Depending on its topography and size, a mediastinal mass may distort the contours of the mediastinum, repress or obliterate mediastinal lines, or determine certain characteristic signs which facilitate the diagnosis. For example:

- **Silhouette Sign:** A thymic mass in an infant obliterates the left edge of the heart, indicating its anterior location.
- **Lymphoma in a 9-year-old Child:** Enlargement of the upper borders of the mediastinum in relation to a mass syndrome of the anterior mediastinum.
- **Cervico-thoracic Sign:** A right upper mediastinal mass not silhouetted by the right border of the mediastinum, with its external limit remaining visible above the clavicle, confirming its posterior location (neurogenic tumor).
- **Iceberg Sign:** The outer edges of the mass remain visible through the abdominal opacity, indicating a pure intrathoracic location, posterior to the left cupola, as demonstrated by the CT scan.

---

A nephrological aetiology is considered if the urological work-up is negative and/or if there is a suggestive nephrological syndrome (highly suggestive associated proteinuria, hypertension, renal failure), or a personal or family history suggestive of hematuric nephropathy.

### A. Glomerular Nephropathy

To be considered if the hematuria is associated with glomerular proteinuria, hypertension, and renal failure, confirmed by renal biopsy:

- **Acquired Recurrent Macroscopic Hematuria Syndrome:** Suggestive of primary IgA nephropathy (mostly in young men: macroscopic hematuria 48 hours after an episode of ENT infection) or congenital: Alport syndrome (family background, deafness, ophthalmological involvement).
- In children, persistent microscopic hematuria should prompt a search for a glomerular cause:
  - Alport syndrome: microscopic or macroscopic hematuria.
  - Acute nephritic syndrome: acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis.

**Acute Nephritic Syndrome:** Most often post-infectious GN (10-15 days after streptococcal ENT infection), hypocomplementemia.

**Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN):** Rapid deterioration in renal function with glomerular syndrome (proteinuria + hematuria) with extra-renal signs revealing systemic disease or vasculitis.

### B. Acute Interstitial Nephropathy

Most often immuno-allergic (often drug-induced), it may combine hematuria with leucocyturia and renal failure, along with signs of the allergic series (skin rash, cytolysis, etc.).

### C. Nephrological Causes with Urological Clinical Presentation

Hematuria due to invasion of the urinary tree, responsible for lumbar pain:

- **Papillary Necrosis:** Migration of papillary fragments into the ureter, mimicking nephritic colic, on a favorable background (diabetes, sickle cell anemia, use of NSAIDs, etc.).
- **Renal Infarction:** Hematuria with sudden lumbar pain, requiring emergency treatment if it involves the main trunk of the renal artery. Causes include thromboembolic or vascular disease, sickle cell disease, or post-trauma.
- **Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD):** Development of renal cysts in which the vessels in the wall may rupture, causing hematuria.

**Description:** Know how to explain the risk of recurrence in the event of a new pregnancy depending on the type of trisomy 21

**Rubric:** Management

**Definitions**

The risk of recurrence depends on the karyotype:

- Free, complete, and homogeneous trisomy 21: recurrence risk of approximately 1% unless the mother is over 40 (risk then linked to the mother's age).
- Mosaic trisomy 21: low risk of recurrence.
- Trisomy 21 by translocation: high risk of recurrence if translocation inherited from a parent.
  - Trisomy 21 by Robertsonian translocation (14;21)
    - If of maternal origin: risk of recurrence 10-15%.
    - If of paternal origin: risk of recurrence 2-5%.
  - Trisomy 21 by Robertsonian translocation (21;21)
    - Risk of recurrence: 100% if inherited from a healthy parent (non-viable monosomy 21).

In the case of free trisomy 21, it is not necessary to carry out the parents' karyotype (de novo occurrence, generally due to meiotic non-disjunction).

In the case of trisomy 21 by translocation, it is necessary to carry out karyotyping of the parents. In the event of a balanced anomaly in one parent, the family branch concerned should be further investigated to identify other carriers.

The increased risk of recurrence after the birth of a child with Down's syndrome means that parents can request a foetal karyotype if they wish.

If the parents do not wish to take the risk of miscarriage, prenatal diagnosis (PND) can be offered.

Men with Down's syndrome have reduced fertility. A few pregnancies have been initiated by men with Down's syndrome, and the children did not have trisomy 21. Fertility in women with trisomy 21 is reduced, but pregnancies are possible. The risk of trisomy 21 is around 30% in women with trisomy 21.",0.0,,False,False,0.7782257795333862,0.5793313384056091,b,False,4,2

**Rubric:** Management  

==D'Amico Classification==

- In the majority of cases, prostate cancer is localized/locally advanced, i.e., confined to the prostate and not metastatic.
- The treatment strategy at this stage is curative according to the D'Amico classification of risk groups.

**To remember about the D'Amico classification:**

- Prognostic classification for localized or locally advanced but non-metastatic prostate cancer.
- Based on three criteria: digital rectal examination, PSA level, and ISUP group.
- Three risk groups (progression, recurrence):
  - Low risk
  - Intermediate risk
  - High risk

D'Amico's prognostic group depends on extension work-up and treatment.

**D'Amico Classification Table:**

- **Low Risk:** PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, ISUP score 1, clinical stage T1c or T2a
- **Intermediate Risk:** PSA between 10 and 20 ng/ml, ISUP score 2 or 3, clinical stage T2b
- **High Risk:** PSA > 20 ng/ml, ISUP score > 3, clinical stage T2c

**Clinical Stages:**

- T1c: Normal rectal examination
- T2a: Abnormality of less than half a prostate lobe on digital rectal examination
- T2b: Abnormality of more than half of a single prostate lobe on rectal examination
- T2c: Abnormality of the two prostatic lobes on rectal examination

==Abstention-Surveillance==

- For frail patients with serious co-morbidities and limited life expectancy, abstention and monitoring are indicated.
- Patients are treated symptomatically when clinical signs related to cancer appear (e.g., pain).

==Active Surveillance==

- For low-risk cancers, it allows the avoidance of complications from more invasive treatments (e.g., urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, digestive transit disorders) without loss of chance.
- Involves performing PSA, TR, pelvic and prostate MRI, and iterative biopsies to ensure the disease is not progressing.
- Invasive curative treatment is indicated if the cancer progresses.
- Theoretical low risk of allowing aggressive cancer to progress.

==Total Prostatectomy==

- This is a curative surgical treatment involving the total removal of the prostate and seminal vesicles.
- Performed all at once, without neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment.
- Can be part of a multimodal treatment combining radiotherapy and hormone therapy for the most aggressive cancers.
- Risks include immediate surgical complications (e.g., haemorrhage, lymphocele, rectal wound, urinary fistula, thrombo-embolism, infection) and long-term functional complications:
  - Erectile dysfunction (most frequent complication)
  - Urinary incontinence (common after surgery but recovers in most cases)
  - Constant infertility and anejaculation
  - Stenosis of the urethrovesical anastomosis (rare)

==External Radiotherapy==

- Irradiation of the prostate cavity for curative purposes and of the pelvic lymph nodes for high-risk cancers.
- May be combined with temporary adjuvant hormone therapy (potentiation).
- Treatment involves daily radiotherapy for 4-6 weeks.
- Risks include increased lower urinary tract symptoms, haematuria, and rectal bleeding during treatment, as well as distant functional and post-radiation complications:
  - Stenosis of the urethra
  - Radiation-induced cystitis/rectitis
  - Erectile dysfunction (most frequent complication)
  - Secondary cancer
  - Urination problems
  - Digestive transit disorders

==Interstitial Brachytherapy==

- Permanent implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate via the perineal route, performed in a single session.
- Treatment with the lowest risk of causing erectile dysfunction.
- Side effects are similar to those of radiotherapy.

==Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)==

- Allows prostate tissue to be destroyed by ultrasound with low morbidity.
- Treatment can be partial or total, with the possibility of a second session if necessary.
- Procedure performed under general anaesthetic in a single session.
- Endoureteral resection is often associated with the procedure to reduce the risk of acute urine retention and severe dysuria.
- A first-line treatment currently being evaluated.

==Dynamic Phototherapy==

- Treatment under evaluation, not feasible outside clinical trials.

**The Indications According to D'Amico's Group (CC-AFU 2022-2024):**

Patients must be informed of treatment modalities and complications, benefits/risks of treatment. All files must be presented to the oncology RCP.

- **Localized Low Risk:** Active surveillance is recommended. Options include total prostatectomy, radiotherapy, brachytherapy. In clinical trials only: cryotherapy, HIFU. Hormonal treatment alone is not recommended.
- **Localized Intermediate Risk:** Total prostatectomy +/- curage, radiotherapy +/- hormone therapy for 6 months, brachytherapy. Active surveillance in selected cases. Cryotherapy and HIFU in clinical trials only. Hormonal treatment alone is not recommended.
- **Localized High Risk:** Long-term hormone therapy (18-36 months) with pelvic radiotherapy, total prostatectomy with curage. Cryotherapy and HIFU are not recommended.

The National Health Insurance Expenditure Target (ONDAM) represents the forecast amount that must not be exceeded for outpatient and inpatient care, whether provided in private or public establishments or in medical and social centers. It is set each year for health insurance expenditure in France and is used to regulate health insurance expenditure. The ONDAM is determined annually by the Social Security Financing Act (LFSS).

The ONDAM was created by ordinance in 1996 and is set each year by Parliament, in accordance with the provisions of the LFSS. It corresponds to revenue forecasts and social security expenditure targets for:

- Outpatient care
- Public and private health establishments
- Medico-social establishments
- Other care

Within healthcare establishments, sub-targets are set for:

- Public and private establishments charged on an activity basis for their medical, surgical, and obstetric activities (ODMCO: objectif des dépenses de MCO), and for their missions of general interest and assistance with contractualization (MIGAC)
- Follow-up and rehabilitation care, psychiatry, and long-term care: the ODAM (health insurance expenditure target) and the OQN (national quantified target)

The Comité d'alerte sur l'évolution des dépenses d'assurance maladie was created by the law of 13 August 2004 on health insurance reform (article 40). It is responsible for alerting Parliament, the Government, and the national health insurance funds in the event of trends in health insurance expenditure that are incompatible with compliance with the national target voted by Parliament.

Each year, by 1 June at the latest, the committee issues an opinion on compliance with the national health insurance expenditure target (ONDAM) for the current financial year.

**Title:** Knowing the Definition of Liability, Penalties, and Compensation

**Rubric:** Definition

The liability of a healthcare professional or institution may be sought for two purposes: either to penalize the professional or institution, or to compensate a user who has suffered the consequences of an adverse event associated with healthcare. The penalty may be criminal or disciplinary in nature. Compensation is the responsibility of the person responsible (self-employed) or their employer if they are employed (public or private). It may also be obtained through an amicable procedure before the conciliation and compensation commissions. Compensation for victims is ensured by the obligation for doctors and health establishments (public or private) to take out professional indemnity insurance. In addition to providing compensation for victims, this insurance covers salaried doctors when the fault is detachable from the service or when the mission entrusted to them is exceeded.

In order to receive compensation for the harmful consequences of a medical act, a user must prove that the act caused the damage, that it gave rise to liability, and that there was a causal link between the act and the damage.

In terms of the liability of healthcare professionals and establishments, damage can take several forms. It may be:

- Physical or mental injury
- Loss of chance of survival or recovery
- A loss of opportunity to have escaped a risk that ultimately materialized (in the case of failure to provide information)

The damage must be present and certain. It may be future if it is certain (for example, the sterility of a child as a result of faulty irradiation).

The causal link between the event giving rise to liability (generally fault) and the damage must be certain. It need not be direct or exclusive.

Of the three elements of liability, causation is usually the most difficult for patients to prove. It is often difficult to distinguish the consequences of the fault from those of the spontaneous evolution of the pathological state of health. The courts accept that compensation may be awarded for loss of chance of survival or recovery. In this case, compensation is awarded in proportion to the probability of survival or recovery lost as a result of the fault.

The same reasoning applies in the case of a failure to provide information. In this case, the patient has lost a chance to escape the risk that ultimately materialized. In other words, if they had been informed of the risk, they could have chosen to run it or to forego the medical procedure. Compensation is awarded in proportion to the probability that the patient would have had of foregoing the procedure if he had been informed of the risk. As a result, if the procedure was essential, the judge concludes that even if the patient had been informed of the risk, he would not have decided to undergo the procedure. The loss of chance is therefore zero.

The courts and the administrative courts also accept that a failure to provide information gives rise to a right to compensation for loss of preparation, as distinct from loss of opportunity. When the risk of which the patient was unaware actually materializes, this compensation compensates the patient for any inconvenience he or she may have suffered as a result of not being able to prepare for this eventuality, in particular by making certain personal arrangements.",0.6666666666666666,19.37,False,True,0.6972435712814331,0.7727337678273519,b,False,2,4

- Above all, ensure the diagnosis is certain, and do not hesitate to refer to a center if in doubt.
- Long-term antibiotic treatment should be the exception rather than the rule and is only necessary in very specific cases. The introduction of such treatment should prompt the patient to seek advice from a referral center.
- Treatment is largely guided by questioning, which often enables identification of risk factors specific to each patient.

== Hygienic and Dietary Measures ==

- Only increasing oral hydration has been formally proven to be effective.
- Post-coital micturition and not retaining micturition seem beneficial; however, it is primarily the ""micturition catalogue"" that will provide information on the ""errors"" made by the patient.
- Regularization of transit, wearing cotton underwear, and wiping from front to back are measures that have not yet been proven effective in the scientific literature.

== Risk Factors Identified in the Literature ==

- Frequency of intercourse (OR = 5.8)
- First cystitis under the age of 15 (OR = 3.9)
- New partner (OR = 1.9)
- Spermicide (OR = 1.8); the only truly modifiable factor

== Non-Antibiotic Treatments Shown to be Effective ==

- Cranberry, but with a low level of evidence. Only oral supplements with a minimum dose of 36 mg/day of type A proanthocyanidin appear to be effective (no benefit from cranberry juice or derivatives).
- Immunoactive prophylaxis (vaccine, not available in France) has been shown to be effective in studies with a high level of evidence.
- Local estrogen therapy has also been shown to be effective, particularly in post-menopausal women.

== Long-Term Antibiotic Prophylaxis ==

If these measures fail and there is more than one episode per month, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis may be offered as follows:

- Continuous trimethoprim
- Fosfomycin-tetamol, one sachet per week
- Taken only in the pericoital period when sexual intercourse is the triggering factor (without exceeding the usual doses; not taken with each act of intercourse if there is frequent sexual activity).

**From a clinical point of view on examination**

- The ADAM (androgen deficiency in aging male) Score should be used to assess symptoms as part of the diagnosis of TDS.

- TDS leads to:
  - Sexuality disorders: Erectile dysfunction (126), lower libido, quality of orgasms (58)
  - Neuropsychological disorders: loss of memory and attention, mood disorders, irritability, sleep disorders.
  - Vasomotor disorders: hypersudation, hot flushes, etc.

The Higham score is used to assess menorrhagia severity.

**From a clinical point of view on physical examination**

- Look for:
  - Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and increased visceral fat.
  - Decreased hair growth with skin atrophy and the appearance of painless gynaecomastia.
  - Signs in favor of sarcopenia: muscle wasting, reduced muscle strength.
  - Signs of reduced bone mineral density: recent fracture, loss of height, etc.

  - Examination of choice for positive diagnosis.
  - Pre-operative extension assessment (visualization of false duct, portal of entry).
  - Used in stabilized patients.

The cross-section of an aortic CT angiogram shows dilatation of the ascending aorta with visualization of the true and false (darker because partially thrombosed) channels of aortic dissection.

- **Trans-Oesophageal Echocardiography (TEE):**
  - Can complement TTE in an unstable patient.
  - Caution: If aortic dissection is suspected, TEE should be performed under anaesthetic cover, ideally in the operating theatre, to avoid a blood pressure spike during TEE while the patient is awake, which is very risky in this context.

**Rubric:** Etiologies

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are frequently associated with atherosclerosis, affecting coronary arteries, carotid arteries, arteries of the lower limbs, and renal and digestive arteries. The existence of familial forms suggests a genetic component in some cases. Vascular prostheses can be complicated by false anastomotic aneurysms.

In rare cases, AAAs may be due to:

- Infectious aneurysm
- Aneurysmal evolution of an aortic dissection
- Hereditary connective tissue dystrophies (e.g., Marfan's disease, vascular Ehlers-Danlos disease, Loeys-Dietz syndrome)
- Inflammatory aortitis (e.g., Takayasu's disease, Horton's disease, and Behçet's disease)

AAA must be detected by ultrasound of the abdominal aorta, often discovered as an abdominal anomaly on medical imaging. This screening is recommended for patients at risk, who include:

- All arteriopaths
- Men aged 60 to 85
- Women aged 60 to 85 who are hypertensive or smokers

**Headache (SD-118):** Severe (VAS of 7 or more) and maximal in less than one minute.

**Brutal Headache:** Maximum in a few minutes. Causes of headaches that peak in less than an hour are similar to those of thunderclap headaches.

**1. Subarachnoid Haemorrhage (SAH) or Meningeal Haemorrhage (item 341)**

- SAH or meningeal haemorrhage: Cause of 10 to 25% of sudden headaches.
- Typical headache (SAH due to rupture of aneurysm): Explosive, thunderclap-like, severe, associated with other signs of meningeal syndrome and persistent cervicalgia.
- Sometimes an isolated, short-lived headache (meningeal epistaxis of low severity, preceding a massive SAH).
- Associated signs: Comitial seizures, focal deficit (if cerebral-meningeal haemorrhage), III paralysis (compression by an aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery or carotid termination), and/or consciousness disorder (transient or coma).

**2. Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS)**

- RCVS: 10 to 45% of thunderclap headaches in emergency departments; under-diagnosed because of recent description (2007).
- SVCR: Segmental and diffuse vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries, reversible within 3 months. May be complicated by cortical SAH without aneurysm and stroke (item 340) (either cerebral haemorrhage or cerebral infarction).
- Typical headache: Thunderclap headache, lasting 5 minutes to several hours and recurring over 1 to 3 weeks, usually provoked by exertion, emotion, Valsalva, or sexual activity.
- Other associated signs: Hypertensive crisis, comitial seizures, and/or focal deficit.
- Evocative contexts: Postpartum, exposure to vasoactive substances (cannabis, cocaine, serotonergic antidepressants, sympathomimetics, nasal decongestants, or triptan) or stress.

**3. Rarer Causes of Sudden Headache**

The following sudden headaches have few specific characteristics and should be investigated after ruling out SAH and if the picture does not suggest CVRS.

- **Intracerebral Hemorrhage:** Headache sometimes isolated, with focal deficit absent or very discreet (frontal or cerebellar hemorrhage) (see stroke item 340).
- **Ischaemic Stroke:** Headache sometimes isolated, with focal deficit absent or very discrete (especially in cerebellar infarction) (see stroke item 340).

  - Carotid dissection: On the side of the dissection: Claude-Bernard Horner, pulsatile tinnitus, paralysis of XII, orbital pain.
  - Vertebral dissection: Posterior neck pain and cervicalgia.
  - Headache precedes signs of retinal or cerebral ischaemia (transient amaurosis, TIA, or stroke) (stroke item 340).
- **Cerebral Venous Thrombosis:** More often gives progressive headaches by JTIC, but sometimes brutal headaches (stroke item 340).
- **Pituitary Apoplexy or Necrosis:** Abrupt headache, visual disturbances, bitemporal hemianopsia, then signs of pituitary insufficiency, postpartum setting, sometimes complicates a pituitary adenoma (pituitary adenoma item 244).

**Measurement of pH and Circulating Blood Gas**

Table 1: Normal Values for Acid-Base Balance Variables

- **Arterial:**
  - pH: 7.38 - 7.42
  - H+ (nmol/L): 37 - 43
  - PCO2 (mmHg): 36 - 44
  - HCO3- (mmol/L): 22 - 26

- **Venous:**
  - pH: 7.32 - 7.38
  - H+ (nmol/L): 42 - 48
  - PCO2 (mmHg): 42 - 50
  - HCO3- (mmol/L): 23 - 27

**Analysis of a Blood Gas Result**

1. **Acidosis or Alkalosis?**
   - Acidaemia (or decompensated acidosis): arterial pH < 7.38 or venous pH < 7.32.
   - Alkalaemia (or decompensated alkalosis): arterial pH > 7.42 or venous pH > 7.38.

   Note: A pH abnormality is not necessary to diagnose an acid-base disorder. For example, a low bicarbonate level with a normal pH may correspond to metabolic acidosis associated with respiratory alkalosis.

2. **Metabolic or Respiratory?**
   - Primary PCO2 abnormalities: acidosis (high PCO2) or alkalosis (low PCO2) known as ""respiratory"".
   - Primary HCO3- abnormalities: so-called ""metabolic"" acidosis (HCO3- low) or alkalosis (HCO3- high).

3. **Compensatory Renal or Respiratory Responses**
   - Decrease in HCO3- if metabolic acidosis → compensatory hyperventilation with parallel decrease in PCO2. The compensatory response can be predicted: expected PaCO2 (mmHg) = 1.5 × [HCO3-] + 8 ± 2.
   - Increase in PCO2 if chronic respiratory acidosis (> 24-48 h) → compensatory generation of HCO3- by the kidney.
   - Increase in HCO3- if metabolic alkalosis → compensatory hypoventilation with increase in PCO2.
   - Decrease in PCO2 if respiratory alkalosis → parallel compensatory decrease in HCO3-.

Sudden death during exercise is in the vast majority of cases of cardiovascular origin.

The causes of contraindications to sporting activities are primarily cardiovascular:

- Cardiac pathologies causing rhythm disorders: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic dysplasia of the right ventricle, birth defects of the coronary arteries, Brugada syndrome, long QT, short QT, etc.
- Progressive or unbalanced cardiovascular pathologies: unstable coronary artery disease, unstable heart failure, unbalanced hypertension, myocarditis, etc.

In addition to cardiovascular causes, there are certain unbalanced or severe pathologies:

- Loss of consciousness not investigated
- Evolving or ongoing respiratory diseases
- Morbid lack of weight and height
- Severe morphological disorders
- Serious neurological pathologies

There are also contraindications specific to certain sports (non-exhaustive list):

- Contact sports: loss of a paired organ (eye, kidney, gonad, etc.) to prevent loss of the second organ during practice.
- Collision or contact sports: haemophilia, anticoagulant treatment
- Boxing: myopia (increased risk of retinal detachment)

- If the uterus is outside the radiation beam (e.g., skull, thorax, limbs), the patient can be reassured.
- If the uterus is in the radiation beam (e.g., intravenous urography, hysterography, pelvic scanner):
  - For a ""standard"" examination (usual number of images and/or duration of scopy), the patient can be reassured. The dose delivered to the uterus is exceptionally greater than 100 mGy, below which the risks are very low (apart from the moderate risk of mutagenesis).
  - For an ""unusual"" examination (very high number of images and/or duration of scopy), seek the advice of a department responsible for calculating the dose-gonad (IRSN).

**Diagnostic X-ray Examination of a Pregnant Woman**

**Precautions for Radiographic Examination on Women of Childbearing Age**

- Pregnant women should not be exposed to ionizing radiation as a matter of principle.
- In radiology, ask any woman of childbearing age whether she is at risk of becoming pregnant at the time of the examination.
- If pregnant, try to replace the irradiating test with non-irradiating tests, such as ultrasound and/or MRI.
- Place a lead apron over the patient's abdomen to limit the dose delivered to the uterus during the examination.
- Limit the number of images taken/scopy time to what is strictly necessary.
- If a radiographic/scopic examination is necessary, do not contraindicate it solely on the grounds of pregnancy: there are often more benefits than risks in carrying it out (benefit/risk balance).
- If the uterus is outside the radiation beam, the planned radiodiagnostic examination can be carried out (do not forget the lead apron).
- If the uterus is in the radiation beam:
  - Prefer an examination without ionizing radiation if possible: MRI or ultrasound.
  - If the radiodiagnostic examination (with or without contrast medium) is necessary for proper management, it can generally be carried out with protective measures or measures to reduce irradiation, discussed on a case-by-case basis with a specialist department.

**Pregnant Woman Occasionally Standing Close to a Patient Undergoing Radiological Examination**

- In these circumstances, as the uterus is not in the radiation beam, irradiation is negligible.
- Pregnant women inadvertently exposed to such conditions should be reassured.
- A pregnant woman may occasionally stand next to a patient undergoing an X-ray examination, wearing a lead apron as a precaution.

**Title:** Knowing the Main Additional Tests to be Prescribed for Hematuria  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Complementary Examinations  

**Definitions**  
Hematuria, whether microscopic or macroscopic, always requires a clinical, biological, and radiological etiological investigation. Isolated macroscopic hematuria should always rule out a urological cause before considering a nephrological cause.

**Confirmatory Tests**  
The urine culture (ECBU) can be used to confirm hematuria (presence of red blood cells in the urine), quantify it, and rule out a urinary tract infection.

**Minimal Work-Up and Assessment**  
- Blood count (CBC)  
- Hemostasis work-up (TP/TCA +/- INR)  
- Assessment of renal function (creatinine level and GFR estimate)  
- Proteinuria detection by dipstick and quantification if positive  

**Minimal Etiological Work-Up**  
- **First Intention Urinary Tract Imaging and Urinary Cytology:** Most often involves urethrovesical fibroscopy (second intention). This work-up must be carried out early.  
  - **Urinary Cytology:** Conducted on morning urine outside the hematuric episode. The pathologist looks for high-grade tumor cells, indicating a potential bladder urothelial carcinoma or upper excretory tract issue.  
  - **First Line Imaging:** Renal-vesical ultrasound  
  - **Uro-Scanner:** Systematic reference examination. It includes an injection-free phase to look for calculi in the urinary tree and assess spontaneous densities, an arterial phase for contrast from renal, bladder, or upper excretory tract tumors, or vascular anomalies, and a late excretory phase which may be combined with a nephrographic phase, often sensitized by the injection of a diuretic. The late excretory time is used to visualize gaps in the urinary tree. Uro-MRI is used when iodine is contraindicated.  
  - **Traumatic Hematuria:** May require, after CT scan, diagnostic and/or therapeutic arteriography in case of active bleeding (arterioembolization).  
  - **Urethrovesical Fibroscopy (or Flexible Urethrocystoscopy):** Performed by a urologist under local anesthetic. Indications include imaging with no obvious etiology, positive urine cytology (CIS = carcinoma in situ), or risk factors for urothelial tumors (age, smoking, or occupational exposure). Inspection of the ureteral meatus can sometimes reveal bloody urine ejaculate and lateralize hematuria from the upper excretory tract. When the etiological diagnosis is obvious (e.g., large bladder tumor), urethrovesical fibroscopy is not necessary. Fibroscopy does not allow biopsies or polyp resection (endoscopic resection using a rigid urethro-cystoscope in the operating theatre under anesthetic).  
  - **Rigid or Flexible Ureteroscopy:** Explores the ureter and renal cavities under general anesthetic in the operating theatre. Indicated if a tumor of the upper urinary excretory tract is suspected.  

**Nephrological Referral**  
In the event of nephrological referral (suggestive personal or family history, edema of the lower limbs, arterial hypertension, renal insufficiency, presence of blood vessels, etc.):  
- Search for proteinuria (24-hour proteinuria or urine protein/creatinine ratio on sample), ideally outside a hematuric episode.  
- A 24-hour proteinuria >2g or a urine protein/creatinine ratio >2g/g (especially if >70% albumin) is suggestive of glomerular hematuria.

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

**Superficial Urticaria**

The primary lesion is an edematous papule, erythematous with a clear border and sometimes a lighter center. There is no particular topography. The shape and size of the papules may vary; there may be annular or polycyclic lesions, and the papules may range from a few millimeters to large, geographically-contoured plaques. The three major characteristics of these edematous papules in superficial urticaria are their ""pruriginous, fleeting, and migratory"" nature.

**Deep Urticaria or Angioedema**

The primary lesion is a firm, non-itchy, pinkish-white edema with a sensation of tension or pain. This edema is transient, receding within 72 hours without scarring, and most often occurs in areas rich in mast cells: the face, extremities, and external genitalia. In the case of anaphylaxis, the edema may be of laryngeal or pharyngeal origin, which may affect the prognosis.

- Superficial urticaria is isolated in 50% of cases.
- Superficial urticaria is associated with deep urticaria in 40% of cases.
- Deep urticaria is isolated in 10% of cases.

**Balance of Benefits and Risks of HRT in Natural Menopause**

**Benefits:**

- **Climacteric Syndrome:** The most effective treatment for the functional signs of menopause.
- **Fracture Risk:** First-line treatment to prevent postmenopausal bone loss.
- **Cardiovascular Impact:** Decreased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) if HRT is started within 10 years of menopause. Risk of stroke and neutral venous thromboembolism (VTE) with cutaneous route plus progesterone or dydrogesterone.

**Risks:**

- Increased risk of MI if HRT is started more than 10 years after menopause.
- **Carcinological Risk:** Decreased risk of colorectal cancer and overall mortality. Increased risk of breast cancer (no excess risk in European observational studies for a duration of 5-7 years). Increased risk of endometrial cancer (mitigated by taking a progestin at least 12 days a month). Increased risk of ovarian cancer (RR=1.14 [1.10-1.19]).

Overall, the benefit/risk balance of HRT is still considered positive in women who are symptomatic and/or at risk of osteoporosis in the first 10 years of menopause or before the age of 60.

== Balance of Benefits and Risks of HRT for Premature Ovarian Failure (POI) ==

In the case of POI, the term ""hormone replacement therapy"" (HRT) is used. In the absence of HRT in women with POI, there is an increase in:

- Cardiovascular mortality
- Osteoporosis
- Cognitive degeneration

Continuation of HRT is recommended until the theoretical age of physiological menopause (no increased risk of breast cancer compared with a woman who is still regulated).

Overall, the benefit/risk balance of HRT is always positive in cases of POI, cancelling out the cardiovascular and bone risks induced by early estrogen deficiency.

== Alternatives to HRT ==

Non-hormonal alternatives for the treatment of flushing are less effective than HRT. Several alternatives are available:

=== Pharmacological Alternatives ===

Certain treatments with a main effect and a marketing authorization (MA) that is not the management of the functional signs of menopause have a demonstrated positive effect on the frequency and severity of BVMs:

- Serotonin reuptake inhibitors
- Clonidine
- Gabapentin

=== Food Supplements, Phytoestrogens, Pollen Extracts, Phytotherapy ===

In general, no proven efficacy compared to placebo. Be careful with phytoestrogens, which are contraindicated if you have a history of breast cancer.

=== Non-Pharmacological Alternatives ===

Nutritional advice must be adapted to cultural, ethnic, and family traditions, as well as to professional constraints, and is inseparable from the action of insulin therapy. Prescription of insulin therapy, follow-up consultation, and education of a type 1 diabetic patient (SD-280).

Carbohydrate intake is defined for each patient based on weight, eating habits, glycaemic profile, and insulin regimen.

The diet should be varied and divided into three main meals, supplemented if necessary by one or two snacks. Snacks are essential during intense physical activity.

The main aim of dietetics in type 1 diabetes is to avoid excessive fluctuations in blood sugar levels, either through the consumption of products with a high glycaemic index or through an inadequate intake of carbohydrates at meals or during physical exercise, which could lead to hypoglycaemia (SD-209) or hyperglycaemia (SD-208).

Patients must learn to take sugar again in the event of hypoglycaemia.

Regular physical activity promotes a better metabolic balance. It requires education to avoid hypo- and hyperglycaemia at the time of sport and/or afterwards. A clinical assessment is necessary when resuming an activity after a long period of inactivity.

Diabetes can cause personal and family distress. Psychological support can improve metabolic control.

== Definitions ==

The diagnosis of cystitis is fairly straightforward, but there are a few important points to bear in mind:

- These are acute symptoms. Old symptoms are very rarely of infectious origin even if bacteriuria is demonstrated.
- The most frequent symptoms of the lower urinary tract are those of the filling phase:
  - Pollakiuria
  - Urinary urgency
  - Incontinence sometimes
- Dysuria is sometimes noted, but this is related to pollakiuria (the patient ""forces an empty bladder"" because the need is felt).
- The main symptom is urinary burning.
- Other frequent symptoms: discreet haematuria, pyuria, bladder tenesmus with pelvic pain/weight at the end of micturition.
- These symptoms are the only way of expressing a ""bladder disorder."" Many pathologies (idiopathic overactive bladder, bladder tumour, etc.) manifest themselves in the same way. It is often a careful history that helps to distinguish between a recent and an old event.

Remember that the evolution of simple cystitis is not pyelonephritis!

In the absence of any anatomical or functional abnormality, cystitis does not become pyelonephritis (hence the classification of cystitis at risk of complications). This rare complication accounts for less than 1% of cystitis cases. This explains why the clinical presentation of acute pyelonephritis (ANP) is febrile back pain without any lower urinary tract symptoms.",1.0,6.705000000000002,False,True,0.7637593150138855,0.6947021484375,b,False,3,4

- The indoor allergen environment, modified by energy-saving measures over the last 50 years (confined indoor air): dust mites, animal allergens, mold, cockroaches, food proteins in house dust.

- Atmospheric pollution (adjuvant role/non-specific inflammation, similar to an adjuvant in a vaccine).

- Decline in microbial biodiversity: The hygienist theory observes an epidemiological relationship between the decline in infectious contacts and the increase in allergic and autoimmune diseases. The current theory suggests that the decline in biodiversity (role of the microbiota) is responsible.

- As a result, the incidence of atopy is lower:
  - In the youngest siblings (more often infected by older siblings).
  - In children who have attended crèches (infectious contagion).
  - In children conceived, born, and raised in rural areas and environments rich in bacterial endotoxins.

**Description:** When faced with unusual clinical signs and/or an incoherent set of symptoms, health professionals must become reflexively aware of the existence of a rare disease. The latest National Plan for Rare Diseases (PNMR3) sets the goal of diagnosing every patient with a rare disease within one year. Every doctor should be aware of the highly structured national organisation, consisting of rare disease centres of reference (CRMRs) and rare disease health networks (FSMRs), which act as relays for the diagnosis of these diseases and promote clear healthcare pathways.

In line with the vision of the IRDiRC consortium (International Consortium for Research into Rare Diseases), the National Plan for Rare Diseases 3 (PNMR3) aims to ensure that all patients suffering from rare diseases receive a precise diagnosis one year after their first specialist medical consultation and can benefit from the care and therapies available. Patients without a precise diagnosis one year after the first specialist consultation are limited to those for whom the current scientific, medical, and technical knowledge does not allow a precise diagnosis. These patients are then said to be at a diagnostic impasse. When faced with unusual clinical signs (e.g., symptoms at an earlier age than usual) and/or an incoherent set of symptoms, health professionals should reflexively suggest a rare disease.

The national organisation is highly structured and is based on the following elements:

- **Centres de Référence Maladies Rares (CRMR):** A CRMR is a network comprising a coordinating site, one or more constituent sites, and, where appropriate, one or more centres of competence (CCMR) or resource and competence centres. They are responsible for coordination, expertise, referrals, research, and training/education.

- **Centre of Competence (CCMR):** Ensures the care and follow-up of people suffering from rare diseases as close as possible to their home, based on an adapted territorial network and in liaison with the CRMR on which it is functionally dependent.

- **Rare Disease Health Network (FSMR):** An organisation that coordinates a network of hospital care centres, diagnostic and research laboratories, social and medico-social structures, universities, associations, and any other partner or institution with complementary expertise in the field of rare diseases concerned.

**Resources:**

- 23 national rare disease health networks (FSMR) mirroring the 24 European Reference Networks (ERN), 20 of which concern rare diseases.

==Main Causes of Failure==

Factors influencing recurrence or the occurrence of thrombosis, in decreasing order of frequency:

- Limited benefit of anticoagulants (incomplete reduction in the risk of thrombosis, particularly in AF and prevention in orthopaedic settings).
- Monitoring (particularly for AODs), often overestimated (AOD dosage possible).
- Drug interactions (e.g., enzyme inducers)
- Other mechanisms (e.g., dissection in stroke)

The medical management of AOMI aims to slow the progression of atheromatous disease by correcting risk factors, particularly tobacco cessation, and instituting systematic drug treatment including:

- In symptomatic patients, an antiplaquettaire, a statin even in the absence of dyslipidaemia, and an IEC even in the absence of hypertension are instituted.
- In asymptomatic patients, a statin even in the absence of dyslipidaemia and an IEC even in the absence of hypertension. Antiplaquettaire treatment is discussed according to the patient's overall cardiovascular risk.

**In Case of Claudication:**

- Walking training should be introduced after assessment of coronary exercise tolerance, based on a personalised programme including regular assessment. It can be practised by self-training at home or optimised by treatment in a specialised centre with supervised rehabilitation and a structured therapeutic education programme. It allows collaterals to be developed and walking distance to be increased.
- Surgical revascularisation improves perfusion in the affected area. Sometimes, without aiming for complete revascularisation, it aims to treat the most significant lesion. It may be performed using endoluminal techniques (angioplasty with or without a stent) or open surgery (endarterectomy or bypass for proximal lesions).
  - In the event of persistent disabling claudication despite optimal medical management for 6 months and control of atheromatous risk factors.
  - It may be discussed from the outset or at an earlier stage in the case of lesions that pose a threat due to their location or haemodynamic impact.

Regular monitoring ensures:

- Adherence to proposed therapeutic lifestyle modifications, walking rehabilitation, and drug prescriptions.
- Achievement of therapeutic targets:
  - LDL cholesterol below 1.4 mmol/L (0.55 g/L) and 50% reduction from baseline.
  - Blood pressure below 120/70 mmHg if well tolerated. In elderly or frail patients, higher blood pressure levels may be tolerated.
  - Glycaemic control
  - Smoking cessation
- Tolerance of treatment; effectiveness of management
- Patency of revascularisation

**In Case of Symptoms at Rest:**

The immediate therapeutic objective is limb salvage in the event of symptoms at rest.

- Revascularisation is essential whenever possible and must be as complete as possible given the high risk of amputation.
- If ischaemia persists despite revascularisation, amputation becomes necessary.
- Amputation from the outset remains a therapeutic option if revascularisation is not possible or if the local situation is life-threatening, in particular extensive necrosis or infection.
- Complementary medical treatment aims to combat aggravating factors such as pain, infection, and malnutrition. Treatment for OAMI is continued or introduced.
- In the case of trophic disorders, multidisciplinary management is preferred.",0.75,12.62714285714286,False,True,0.7039477229118347,0.6258528431256613,d,False,4,2

**Rubric:** Definition  

**Basics of Genetic Counselling**

Genetic counselling involves informing the patient and/or parents and/or family members about the risk of occurrence or recurrence of a genetic disease. It is the process by which patients or relatives at risk of a hereditary disease are advised and informed about:

- The nature and consequences of the disease
- The likelihood of developing it or passing it on to their offspring
- The options available for life and family planning to prevent illness or improve their situation

This process can be broken down into two parts: diagnosis (risk assessment) and a second, more complex part involving advice based on the diagnosis.

Genetic counselling can take place:

- Before conception (when one or both parents are carriers of a certain genetic trait or when a relative has a genetic disease)
- During pregnancy (if an abnormality is detected on ultrasound or if a risk of genetic disease is identified; risk of trisomy 21 following screening, for example)
- After birth (if a congenital disorder or malformation is found)
- During childhood (if the child shows signs of developmental delay)
- In adulthood (for genetic diseases that manifest in adulthood, such as Huntington's disease or hereditary cancers)
- Post-mortem for family members

Since 2011, in France, the Bioethics Act on information to relatives stipulates that the doctor or genetic counsellor must inform the patient/parents, prior to the genetic examination, that if a genetic anomaly is found, they must inform the family members potentially concerned.

**Possibilities of Prenatal Diagnosis (Management Methods and Options in the Case of a Particularly Serious Disease)**

Prenatal diagnosis is part of foetal medicine. It involves examinations carried out on pregnant women to diagnose a disease (infectious, haematological, genetic, etc.) in the foetus.

If a risk has already been identified in the family, the couple can decide on:

- The absence of any particular action and the assumption of the stated risk
- Adoption
- A request for prenatal diagnosis
- A request for pre-implantation diagnosis

Antenatal diagnosis can also be carried out following the identification of an anomaly during pregnancy monitoring (biological or ultrasound). The couple's proposal for an examination is discussed at the CPDPN (Multidisciplinary Centre for Prenatal Diagnosis). The couple is then offered genetic tests, which require invasive sampling to collect foetal material (cells, DNA), most often by chorionic villus puncture or amniocentesis.

- Fetal karyotype if an abnormality in chromosome number is suspected
- Chromosomal analysis on a DNA chip (ACPA or CGH array) in cases of suspected unbalanced chromosomal abnormality other than an abnormal number
- Targeted sequencing/analysis in cases of suspected gene syndrome or genetic disease identified in the family
- Some centres are beginning to offer exome testing in cases where there is a suspicion of a gene syndrome but no clear indication

If a woman is diagnosed with a particularly serious illness that is incurable at the time of diagnosis, she may request a medical termination of pregnancy (IMG) on medical grounds, regardless of the term. This request is discussed at a CPDPN and may be accepted if the illness meets the two criteria mentioned above:

- Particular gravity
- Incurable at the time of diagnosis

The CPDPN can also suggest drug therapies and, in rare cases, surgery to treat the foetus, as in the case of diaphragmatic hernia.

**Prenatal Screening for Trisomy 21**

Doctors must inform patients of the possibility of prenatal screening for trisomy 21, which is covered by the health insurance scheme. This screening must be preceded by information to the patient about trisomy 21 and the screening procedures, and requires her prior written consent. The screening process is not compulsory, and the patient may withdraw from the process at any time.

Screening enables a risk to be assessed but does not provide a definitive diagnosis. In the event of positive screening, the definitive diagnosis will be made by carrying out a foetal karyotype.

In the event of a confirmed diagnosis of trisomy 21, it is essential to arrange a systematic consultation with a geneticist to provide information on the prognosis and genetic counselling, prior to any decision to terminate a pregnancy for medical reasons, even if the parents decide to do so in advance.",0.6666666666666666,14.250000000000004,False,True,0.7572845220565796,0.6398599545160929,b,False,4,3

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

== Optic Nerve Damage ==

=== Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy (NOIA) ===

NOIA is caused by acute ischaemia of the optic nerve head due to occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries (PCA) or their branches. It is characterized by a sudden unilateral drop in visual acuity, associated with papilledema and visual field damage, typically in the form of an altitudinal deficit.

Horton's disease or gigantocellular arteritis (also known as arteritic optic neuropathy) should be considered first due to the need for systemic corticosteroids to be administered urgently. A systematic search should be made for evidence of Horton's disease: systemic signs of the disease, changes in the temporal arteries, suggestive ocular signs (episodes of fleeting amaurosis preceding the onset of NOIA, choroidal filling defect on fundus angiography indicative of choroidal ischaemia), biological signs (accelerated sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein), and temporal artery biopsy (should be performed as soon as possible, but there is no reason to wait for it before starting corticosteroid therapy). The risk of bilateralization and complete, bilateral, permanent blindness means that any suspected case of Horton's disease must be treated with high-dose corticosteroids urgently.

Arteriosclerosis (also known as non-arteritic optic neuropathy) is the most common cause of NOIA, due to occlusion of the PCAs or one of their branches by in situ thrombosis. Risk factors generally include smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.

The differential diagnosis includes other causes of papilledema.

=== Papilledema ===

This is a swelling of the optic nerve head following an increase in intracranial pressure. In the presence of papilledema, malignant arterial hypertension (if bilateral) and intracranial hypertension (if bilateral) should be ruled out, followed by inflammatory optic neuropathy.

Symptoms of intracranial hypertension include headache, nausea/vomiting, transient visual disturbances such as visual eclipses, and VI nerve paralysis. Initially, there is no loss of visual acuity and no visual field abnormalities other than enlargement of blind spots.

In cases of inflammatory optic neuritis with papillitis, visual acuity is predominantly impaired.

=== Retro-bulbar Optic Neuritis (RBON) ===

Damage is often rapidly progressive (over a few hours to a few days) and can cause a drop in visual acuity of varying severity. This is associated with the appearance of a scotoma, usually central or caecocentral. Visual impairment is often accompanied by retro-orbital pain, which increases when the eyeballs are moved. Retrobulbar optic neuritis should be investigated first and foremost for multiple sclerosis, which is the main cause, particularly in young patients.

Other causes of optic nerve damage include:

- Toxic and drug-induced optic neuropathies: These neuropathies are bilateral and progressive. They are dominated by four causes: ethylic optic neuropathy, optic neuropathies related to anti-tuberculosis treatments (ethambutol and isoniazid), occupational optic neuropathies (e.g., lead), and metabolic optic neuropathies (diabetes).

- Tumoral optic neuropathies, linked to intra-orbital tumors or tumors in the anterior part of the skull (sphenoid meningioma, etc.).

== Damage to the Optic Chiasm ==

Compression of the optic pathways at the level of the chiasma results in a very specific aspect of the visual field known as ""chiasmatic syndrome,"" which, in its typical form, results in a bitemporal hemianopia, i.e., a deficit in the temporal hemifields (corresponding to damage to the nasal fibers which decussate at the level of the chiasma). Sometimes the compression is partial (particularly in the early stages) and a bitemporal quadranopsia is observed.

In terms of aetiology, the main cause of chiasmatic syndrome is pituitary adenoma. Chiasmatic syndrome is often progressive in onset, beginning with superior bitemporal quadranopsia.

== Retrochiasmatic Disease ==

This results in a sensory deficit in one hemifield, right or left (the same on both sides), called homonymous lateral hemianopia, with the deficit on the opposite side to the lesion. Damage to the optic radiations, where the upper and lower fibers travel in two clearly separated bundles, is more likely to result in homonymous lateral quadranopsia, usually superior.

In terms of aetiology, there are three main causes: vascular (stroke, compressive hematoma), tumor, and trauma.

A sudden onset of hemianopsia or homonymous lateral quadranopsia caused by damage to the retrochiasmatic optic pathways suggests a vascular etiology, whereas a progressive onset suggests a tumor etiology.",0.3333333333333333,7.190000000000001,False,True,0.7442323565483093,0.6691020727157593,b,False,2,4

**Rubric:** Care  

## Parent-child bonding  
Parent-child bonding is the result of a maturative process that begins before birth and needs to be promoted during the first few days of life. After birth, skin-to-skin contact with the mother should be encouraged if the condition of the newborn and the mother allow it. Early initiation of breastfeeding (within the first hour) should be offered if breastfeeding is desired. Clinical examinations and care of the newborn are carried out in the presence of the parents. Staying in hospital after giving birth is a good opportunity to support the parents and learn how to care for the newborn. This period also provides an opportunity to observe the family and identify any psycho-social difficulties.

## Breastfeeding (Management of normal and difficult breastfeeding)  
The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. Breastfeeding has many advantages:  
- A nutritional model adapted to physiological needs  
- Reduced risk of infection  
- Prevention of atopy  
- Contribution to the mother-child bond  
- Economic advantage  

Breastfeeding should begin early (within the first hour of life). The mother should be given information on:  
- Correct positioning of the newborn  
- Correct latching of the baby  
- Nipple hygiene  
- Stopping smoking and alcohol consumption  
- The frequency and duration of feeds (breastfeeding on demand, 8 to 12 feeds)  
- Assessing the effectiveness of breastfeeding (stools several times a day, copious urination, weight gain 200-250g per week)  
- Administration of vitamin K at 1 month of age and daily administration of vitamin D (1000 to 1200 IU)  
- Complications of breastfeeding (insufficient lactation, sore and cracked nipples, engorgement, lymphangitis)  
- Start of dietary diversification between 4 and 6 months of age  

Contraindications to breastfeeding are rare (maternal HIV infection, maternal heart or kidney disease, galactosemia in children, certain drugs).

## Regular medical check-ups  
- 14 medical examinations during the first 3 years, including 1 in the first week, 1 in the second week, and one a month until the child is 6 months old  
- Preventive measures (unexpected infant death syndrome, transmission of infections, domestic accidents)  
- Risks associated with passive smoking  
- Prompt medical consultation in the event of fever before 3 months, eating difficulties, respiratory discomfort, diarrhoea, vomiting, unusual behaviour  
- Vaccinations: check the parents' anti-pertussis vaccination and inform them of the child's vaccination schedule  
- Sun protection  
- Information on shaken baby syndrome  

## Leaving the maternity unit  
- Update of the health record (clinical examination, date of compulsory screening, diet chosen, and discharge weight must be recorded)  
- Discharge prescription: vitamin supplementation (vitamin D+/- vitamin K), care of the umbilical cord until it falls off, diet

**Epidemiology**

- Primary infection linked to the VZV virus (Varicella Zoster Virus), Herpesviridae, subfamily alpha-herpesvirinae.
- Very frequent infection in children
- Human-to-human contagiousness: airborne (aerosol) or contact with vesicles
- Primary infection with VZV results in chickenpox, reactivation results in shingles

**Clinical Features**

- Incubation: 2 weeks
- Contagion: 2 days before rash until lesions crust over (about 1 week)
- Most often a benign infection in children, but more severe in infants under 1 year of age and adolescents.
- Classic form: 2-stage evolution
  - Pre-eruptive: fever
  - Eruptive: vesicles appearing in successive outbreaks (lesions of different ages), all over the body, possibly reaching the mucous membranes (mouth), progressing to crusting, accompanied by pruritus which is sometimes very intense. A fever accompanies the eruption (fever as long as there are new vesicle outbreaks, if fever when there are no new lesions beware of bacterial superinfection). The image shows typical varicella lesions.
- Severe forms (subjects at risk)
  - Neonatal: chickenpox in the mother with a rash from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery. Children need to be treated with anti-VZV immunoglobulin and aciclovir, even if asymptomatic, because of the severity.
  - In immunocompromised patients: risk of severe pneumonia, fulminant hepatitis, multiple organ failure. Systematic treatment is required.
  - Pregnant women: foetopathy before 20 weeks' gestation, pneumonia in pregnant women
  - Adolescents and adults: profuse form, respiratory involvement

**Complications**

- Viral (see subjects at risk above): pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis
- Bacterial superinfections:
  - Cutaneous (Streptococcus A and Staphylococcus aureus): dermohypodermatitis, fasciitis, toxic shock. Promoting role of NSAIDs
  - Respiratory: acute otitis media, pleuropneumonia
- Post-infectious: cerebellar ataxia (cerebellite), thrombocytopenic purpura
- Metabolic: Reye's syndrome in association with aspirin use

**Treatment and Prevention**

Treatment is symptomatic, with severe forms or chickenpox occurring in subjects at risk warranting the prescription of IV aciclovir.

Prevention is based on avoiding subjects at risk. In the event of exposure to a subject at risk, treatment with a specific immunoglobulin is indicated.

Post-exposure vaccination is justified in cases where it is not contraindicated (live vaccine therefore contraindicated in pregnant women and immunocompromised patients), i.e., in adolescents over 11 years of age and non-immune adults within 72 hours of contact.

**Title:** Know the definition and natural history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and how to search for other aneurysmal locations  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Definition  

== Aneurysm of the Abdominal Aorta ==

An arterial aneurysm is a focal and permanent dilatation of the artery with a loss of parallelism of its walls, and whose diameter is greater than 1.5 times the upstream diameter. The most common location is the abdominal aorta. The most common peripheral aneurysms are in the popliteal arteries. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) develop preferentially in the sub-renal segment. It may be confined exclusively to the sub-renal aorta or extend to the iliac arteries.

=== Epidemiology ===

The main risk factors are smoking, advanced age, male sex, and a family history of AAA. AAA is often associated with atheromatous lesions in other arterial territories (coronary arteries, carotid arteries, visceral arteries, arteries of the lower limbs). The prevalence of AAA is 5% in men aged over 65. The prevalence in women is not well known and is lower than in men.

=== Natural History ===

The diameter of the AAA increases over time. In the same patient, the rate of growth is not linear and there are variations from one patient to another. The greater the aortic diameter, the faster the rate of growth. An AAA is said to be ""fast-growing"" if it increases by more than 1 cm per year. The risk of AAA developing is rupture, and this risk increases with the diameter. It is low for a diameter of less than 40 mm, and high above 55 mm. For the same diameter, the risk of rupture is greater in women.

=== Other Aneurysmal Locations ===

- **Popliteal Artery Aneurysms**:  
  AAA can be associated with aneurysms in other locations, most often in the popliteal arteries. Aneurysms of the popliteal arteries almost exclusively affect men and are often bilateral (50% of cases). A popliteal artery aneurysm is either asymptomatic, discovered during the clinical examination (popliteal pulses too well perceived), or during ultrasound exploration (for example, during the assessment of an AAA). It may also be discovered in the setting of acute ischaemia, critical ischaemia, or, more rarely, stress ischaemia. The main risk is lower limb ischaemia (acute ischaemia or critical ischaemia), due to iterative low-noise emboli obstructing the downstream arterial network, or thrombosis of the aneurysm, the two mechanisms often being associated. The risk of lower-limb amputation following popliteal aneurysm thrombosis is high. Rarely, popliteal artery aneurysms cause local compression (veins, nerves). Venous compression may be responsible for popliteal and sub-popliteal venous thrombosis. Rupture is exceptional and should raise suspicion of an infectious origin.

- **Aneurysms of the Iliac or Femoral Arteries**:  
  More rarely, other locations associated with AAA involve the femoral, common iliac, or internal iliac arteries. They are systematically investigated by ultrasound or CT angiography.

- **Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms**:  
  AAA may be associated with a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT angiography is recommended to assess the extent of aneurysmal disease.",0.5,11.22727272727273,False,True,0.794974684715271,0.7087131937344869,b,False,5,3

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Taking charge

**Definitions:**

Emergency medical structures include the Samu-Centre 15, the mobile emergency and resuscitation services (SMUR), and the emergency services or emergency structures (SU).

**Samu-Centre 15:**

The Samu-Centre 15 is a hospital service whose mission is to respond to emergency situations:

- Provides a permanent medical listening service, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
- Determines and triggers the most appropriate response to the call in the shortest possible time.
- Ensures the availability of public or private hospital facilities appropriate to the patient's condition.
- If necessary, organizes the patient's transport and hospital reception.

In addition, the Samu:

- Participates in drawing up emergency plans and dealing with exceptional health situations.
- Contributes to the initial and ongoing training of healthcare professionals within the emergency care teaching centers (CESU).

The Samu has had a call reception and regulation center (CRRA) with a single national call number since 1978, ""15"", to provide permanent medical assistance. This is known as the Samu-Centre 15.

**Emergency Call Management:**

The call is initially taken by a medical regulation assistant (ARM) responsible for identifying the location of the distress, the caller, and the nature of the call. The call is then handled by a medical regulator (MR) who, while questioning the caller and, if possible, the patient himself, will determine the need for care and commit the necessary resources. This is ""act I"" of medical regulation, a telemedicine act recognized by the regulations and the professional orders. The commitment of resources can be made during the dialogue with the caller, as the medical questioning does not delay the intervention of a team, which is activated while the discussion continues. The emergency medical technician also has an advisory role, advising a witness or the patient on the actions to be taken before the arrival of first aid and/or medical resources. This assistance with actions over the telephone, in which MRAs and emergency medical technicians are trained, is particularly important in the event of a cardiac arrest. The rest of the intervention (""act II"" of medical regulation) is carried out by the MRAs and the RSMs to organize the follow-up to the call and, if necessary, the transport and admission of the patient to a care facility. At this stage, the RSO will be able to advise the teams on site and, above all, direct the patient to the right care.

**Link to Item 17:** Telemedicine, telehealth, and telehealth services.

**Les Services Mobiles d'Urgence et de Réanimation (SMUR):**

The mission of the SMUR, triggered by the Samu-Centre 15, is to take charge, on the spot, outside the hospital, of medical distress and provide emergency care before and during the transport of the patient to the appropriate establishment, designated by the Samu. SMURs may specialize in transporting children (SMUR Pédiatriques).

**Structures des Urgences (SU):**

A hospital service, the SU is responsible for dealing with unscheduled admissions to a public or private health establishment, 24 hours a day, every day of the year, of any unselected person presenting in an emergency situation, including psychiatric emergencies. Emergency Departments are an essential point of entry into the healthcare system. Reception is formalized around the reception organizing nurse (IOA). The ED is generally organized into care pathways, often with specific premises and staff. The life-saving emergency room deals with serious patients. This is a standard feature of an ED, as is a pediatric care unit. There is usually also a short rapid care pathway and a long pathway for patients requiring several additional examinations and hospitalization.",0.6666666666666666,7.58666666666667,False,True,0.6330397129058838,0.7128509481747946,c,False,2,3

**Description:** Information, education, nutritional advice, triage of gout attacks, hypouricemic treatment.  
**Rubric:** Management  

**Definitions**

Four simple principles govern management, based on patient education:

- Patients must be informed of the importance of treating a gout attack at the earliest signs. They must be able to self-treat according to a predefined treatment explained and prescribed by their doctor.

- Patients should be aware that treating an attack alone is not enough to treat gout, and should understand the importance of hypouricemic treatment, which alone can permanently relieve the symptoms of gout.

- The choice of treatment for a gout attack depends on:
  - Co-morbidities (cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency defined by an estimated GFR <60 ml/min, diabetes, peptic ulcer, infections).
  - A history of drug intolerance.
  - Potential drug interactions.
  - The number and type of joints affected.

- The drugs that can be used to treat the crisis are:
  - Colchicine: 1 mg at the onset of the attack, followed by ½ mg an hour later, i.e., 1.5 mg on day 1 and continued on subsequent days at 0.5 mg × 2-3 per day depending on progress.
  - NSAIDs per os: at the onset of the attack and for a short period during the attack. They should be avoided in cases of renal insufficiency or severe cardiovascular disease.
  - Oral corticosteroid therapy: from the onset of the attack, at a dose of 30 to 35 mg per day (prednisone equivalent) for 3 to 5 days.
  - Local corticosteroid therapy (intra-articular).
  - IL-1 inhibitors: in hospital, if other treatments have failed or are contraindicated.

Other pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures may be combined:

- Rest (simple brace, orthosis) and joint icing (with skin protection, which shortens the duration of access).
- Analgesic medication according to pain assessment.",1.0,10.356923076923078,False,True,0.7722262740135193,0.6641764243443807,b,False,5,3

**Description:** Understanding the sources of funding for social protection.

Social security contributions are compulsory payments made by self-employed persons, employees, and employers to acquire entitlement to social security benefits. These contributions cover health, maternity, disability, and death insurance; old age insurance; unemployment insurance; and family allowances. There is also the ""contribution solidarité autonomie"" (CSA, or solidarity day) payable by public and private employers who are liable for the employer's health insurance contribution.

Social security contributions account for the bulk of social protection resources. However, since 1990, the proportion of social security contributions in social welfare funding has been declining in favor of fiscal resources, such as the CSG (general social contribution), and exemptions on employers' contributions. Earmarked taxes account for a growing proportion of social protection resources. They include:

- Transfers of tax resources paid on a permanent basis to social security schemes (particularly the farmers' scheme).
- Taxes on products (e.g., taxes on alcohol, tobacco, motor insurance).
- Taxes on wages and labor.
- Taxes on income and wealth, which is the largest proportion of social protection tax resources. They include the CSG and the contribution to the repayment of the social debt (CRDS).

State public contributions finance solidarity spending (RSA, old age solidarity fund), part of the exemptions from employer contributions, and subsidize schemes.

The origin of social protection resources, particularly in pension schemes where the number of active contributors is less than the number of pensioners, is illustrated in a graph. The breakdown of social protection resources by type of levy in 2020 shows a decline in the share of social contributions due to the drop in professional activity during 2020 (confinements). This highlights the importance of economic activity in generating financial resources for social protection.

**Description:** Knowing how to refer a case to ONIAM

**Rubric:** Definition

== Reasons for Referral ==

ONIAM and the CCI are separate institutions, but they work towards the same goal within the same procedure: to compensate victims of medical accidents as fairly as possible.

- **ONIAM:** Office National d'Indemnisation des Accidents Médicaux, des Affections Iatrogènes et des Infections Nosocomiales (National Office for Compensation for Medical Accidents, Iatrogenic Diseases and Nosocomial Infections).
- **CCI:** Commission de Conciliation et d'Indemnisation des accidents médicaux (Conciliation and Compensation Commission for Medical Accidents)

The ICCs, which meet between one and four times a month, are chaired by a magistrate and are made up of members representing:

- Users
- Healthcare professionals
- Health establishments
- Insurers
- ONIAM
- Qualified personalities

A case may be referred to the CCI if a patient (or their beneficiaries in the event of death) is the victim of a ""medical accident,"" an ""iatrogenic condition,"" or a ""nosocomial infection"" resulting in ""serious harm.""

A medical accident is considered ""serious"" if it causes damage in excess of the following thresholds:

- A rate of permanent physical or mental injury (AIPP) of more than 24%
- Temporary cessation of professional activities (ATAP) for a period of at least six consecutive months or six non-consecutive months in any twelve-month period
- Temporary discomfort constituting a functional deficit (DFT) equal to or greater than 50% for a period of at least six consecutive months or six non-consecutive months over a period of twelve months

Or exceptionally:

- When the victim is declared definitively unfit to carry out the professional activity they were performing before the medical accident
- When the medical accident, iatrogenic condition, or nosocomial infection causes ""particularly serious problems,"" including economic problems, in the victim's living conditions

== Referral Procedure ==

**Step 1: Preparation of the File by the Victim**

Within 10 years of consolidation of the state of health and as part of a free procedure, the victim sends the CCI a claim form accompanied by various supporting documents.

*Consolidation is the date at which it can be considered that the victim's state of health is no longer likely to change, worsen, or improve. In the absence of consolidation of the victim's state of health before their death, the starting point for the limitation period is the date of the victim's death.

**Step 2: Assessment of the Application by the ICC**

From the date of receipt of a complete file, the ICC has 6 months to give its opinion on the circumstances, causes, nature, and extent of the damage suffered by the victim and on the applicable compensation scheme.

The ICC's assessment of cases is based on expert opinions. These expert reports are requested by the Chairman of the CCI from medical experts in the discipline involved in the case under review, who are on the list of experts.

**Step 3: Compensation Offer**

The Office National d'Indemnisation des Accidents Médicaux, des Affections Iatrogènes et des Infections Nosocomiales (ONIAM) or the insurer of the healthcare provider in question (depending on whether it concerns a therapeutic hazard or a fault) has a period of 4 months from receipt of the notice to make an offer of compensation to the victim and a period of 1 month to pay if the victim accepts the offer.

**Optional Step**

If the insurer refuses or remains silent after the 4-month period, the victim may ask ONIAM to take the place of the insurer. ONIAM then has a period of 4 months from receipt of a valid request to inform the victim of its position and make a proposal for compensation. ONIAM can then take action against the insurer.",0.4,15.420000000000002,False,True,0.7746763229370117,0.6872596144676208,c,False,2,4

- To obtain or renew a federal sports licence
- To take part in a sports competition if the patient is not a member of a sports federation

This medical certificate must be less than one year old on the day of application for the federal licence or registration for the competition.

Any medical doctor can draw up this certificate, which states that there are no contraindications to practising the sport, in competition where applicable, and mentions the contraindicated discipline(s) where appropriate.

If a sports patient renews their licence with the same federation from one year to the next, the medical certificate is only required every three years. During the two intervening years, the athlete can obtain a licence by certifying to his or her federation that he or she has answered NO to each of the sections of the ""QS-SPORT"" health questionnaire available online.

**Definitions**

Several definitions of heart failure co-exist:

- From a pathophysiological point of view, heart failure is defined as an inability of the heart to deliver sufficient flow to meet the body's needs and/or to function with normal filling pressures.

- There is also a universal definition of chronic heart failure (CHF): this is a clinical syndrome with past or present symptoms of CHF (dyspnoea, fatigue) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac anomaly and confirmed by several elements: clinical signs of heart failure (crackles, ankle oedema, jugular turgidity); an elevated level of natriuretic peptide; haemodynamic echocardiographic radiological signs.

Heart failure is classified according to the level of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which corresponds to the proportion of blood ejected with each beat in relation to the ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEF (%) = (end-diastolic volume - telesystolic volume)/end-diastolic volume). Three types of heart failure are classically distinguished:

- Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤40%) caused by failure of myocardial contraction.

- Systolic heart failure or heart failure with a slightly reduced ejection fraction between 41 and 49%, generally combines the characteristics of the other two types.

- Diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (LVEF ≥50%). This is caused by a failure to fill the left ventricle (relaxation compliance).

This definition has therapeutic implications, as most treatment options concern heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤40%).

The LVEF calculation involves determining the endocardial contours in telediastole on the left and telesystolic on the right.",0.3333333333333333,16.816,False,True,0.7688590288162231,0.8645088275273641,a,False,3,4

**Title:** Knowing the Three Main Protective Measures  
**Description:** Understand situations that can lead to legal protection measures, curatorship, and guardianship.

Illness, disability, or accident can alter a person's intellectual or physical faculties, preventing them from expressing their wishes and defending their interests alone. This person may be placed under a legal protection measure, which involves appointing another person to assist or represent them in their interests.

There are several forms of personal protection, the three main ones being legal protection, curatorship, and guardianship.

**1) Safeguard of Justice:**

Safeguard of justice is a temporary protective measure with limited effects, used to address an emergency situation where a person of legal age is at risk of taking action contrary to their interests. It is implemented pending either the person's recovery or the pronouncement of a curatorship or guardianship measure.

In its form, the safeguard of justice can be:

- **Medical:** Resulting from a statement made by a doctor (either the doctor of the person to be protected or the doctor of the health establishment where the person is) to the public prosecutor.
- **Judicial:** Requested by the guardianship judge, particularly if an application is made to the judge to place the person under guardianship or curatorship.

The person under court protection retains the capacity to perform all acts, but certain important acts (e.g., the sale of a property) may be specially entrusted to a proxy.

**2) Guardianship and Curatorship:**

The difference between guardianship and curatorship lies in the degree of constraint imposed by these measures. The consequences of establishing guardianship are greater than those of curatorship.

- **Guardianship:** A person placed under guardianship remains autonomous in everyday life but must be accompanied by a guardian for important acts. The guardianship judge defines the actions that the person may or may not take on their own, depending on their condition. Guardianship is a more protective measure. A guardian represents the adult to be protected in everyday life. The guardianship judge determines which acts the protected person may or may not perform alone.

There are three types of acts defined by law:
- Acts that the protected person can carry out themselves (e.g., shopping).
- Acts that require the guardian's authorization (e.g., renewing an identity card).
- Acts that require the guardianship judge's authorization (e.g., changing residence).

The duration of the protective measure is determined by the guardianship judge. If the protected person's condition does not seem likely to improve, the guardianship judge may decide to renew the guardianship.

**3) Protection of Minors:**

Guardianship of a minor is a legal protection measure whereby another person helps to protect the minor's interests when the holders of parental authority can no longer exercise them. In this case, the judge appoints a family council, which appoints a guardian and a subrogated guardian (a person appointed by the family council to represent the protected person when the latter's interests conflict with those of the guardian. This person has an obligation to monitor the management of the guardian).

To find out about the main implications of these protective measures, particularly regarding the rights of protected patients of full age, please refer to the previous knowledge objective (OIC-009-10-B Principles and Purposes of Personal Protection Measures).

In the event of a decrease in visual acuity with a white, painless eye, a fundus examination guides the diagnosis and treatment.

1. **Fundus Not Visible or Poorly Visible:** Intravitreal haemorrhage.  
   The cause of the haemorrhage is easy to recognize when the retina remains visible. A massive haemorrhage renders the retina invisible on fundus examination. If the retina is not visible, B-ultrasound should be performed to rule out retinal detachment.  
   The main causes of intravitreal haemorrhage are as follows:
   - Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
   - Occlusions of the central retinal vein or one of its branches
   - Retinal tearing, whether or not complicated by retinal detachment
   - Terson's syndrome: Uni- or bilateral intravitreal haemorrhage associated with meningeal haemorrhage due to rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (Terson's syndrome may also be associated with meningeal haemorrhage of traumatic origin).

2. **Clearly Visible and Abnormal Fundus:**  
   - Occlusion of the central retinal artery or one of its branches: This is a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and, as such, the patient should be admitted urgently to a neurovascular unit to prevent another life-threatening vascular event. It should look for carotid atheroma and embologenic heart disease. In a young patient, a carotid dissection should also be sought.
   - Occlusion of the central retinal vein or one of its branches
   - AMD complicated by macular choroidal neovessels: This requires rapid initiation (within a few days of diagnosis) of treatment with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF.
   - Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD): The spontaneous evolution is very negative, with the detached retina suffering irreversible damage within a few weeks. A recent RD is a surgical ""semi-emergency"", justifying an operation within a few days of diagnosis, often less than a week when the macula is detached and even more urgent when the macula is still flat.
   - Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NOIA): This must be ruled out as an emergency.

**Title:** Prevention: Understanding the Prevention of Errors, EIAS, the Concept of the Safety Barrier.

**Description:** None

The management of errors and complaints is an essential element in the prevention of risks associated with healthcare. It is an a posteriori approach to risk. A risk has occurred resulting in harm to a patient. This harm may be real or perceived by the patient.

An in-depth analysis of errors and the reasons for complaints will enable us to identify ways of preventing further errors by implementing improvement measures.

**Basics of In-Depth Analysis of Error Causes**

**Reason's Model**

Reason's model (or the Swiss cheese model) is the model most often presented. It highlights the latent causes of an accident, distinguishing between active and latent errors. This helps us understand that human error is often a consequence of deeper organizational flaws. This model proposes an analysis of undesirable events in successive sequences where different levels of defense at each stage have been overcome. This concept of successive barriers has now been replaced by a systemic model, which is too complex to be detailed here.

**Safety Barriers**

Barriers are in-depth defenses (protections) against the risk of error. There are three types of safety barriers:

- Prevention barriers
- Recovery barriers
- Mitigation barriers

An effective safety system must have all three. Neither recovery nor mitigation barriers should be neglected.

These three types of barriers can be:

- Intangible: laws and regulations, instructions, good safety practice, recommendations, procedures and protocols, training programs, work organization, etc.
- Material: physical coding (e.g., special design of medical gas and vacuum connection rings to prevent inappropriate connections of different colors).

**Prevention Barriers**

They are designed to prevent errors and accidents from occurring, such as the surgical checklist, an intangible barrier that breaks down into three stages, or computerized prescribing in a system that provides alerts based on dangerous doses, the patient's clinical and biological condition, drug interactions, etc.

**Operating Theatre Checklist**

Before Anaesthetic Induction:
- Verification of:
  - Patient identity
  - Procedure and surgical site (patient, records)
  - Availability of clinical and paraclinical documentation
  - Knowledge of the installation method, consistent with the site/intervention, not dangerous for the patient
  - Skin preparation of the patient being operated on, documented in the department/operating theatre liaison sheet
  - Equipment/materials required for the operation, with no malfunctions

- Cross-check by the risk team:
  - Allergic
  - Inhalation
  - Intubation difficulties
  - Ventilation
  - Bleeding

Before Surgery:
- Pause time before incision:
  - Ultimate cross-check within the team, in the presence of the surgeon(s), anaesthetist(s)/IADE, IBODE/IDE:
    - Patient identity
    - Planned intervention
    - Surgical site
    - Correct installation
    - Availability of the necessary documents

- Sharing information orally within the team on the elements at risk/critical stages of the intervention (time out) in terms of:
  - Surgical
  - Anaesthetic

- In accordance with current protocols:
  - Administration of antibiotic prophylaxis
  - Preparation of the operating field

After Surgery:
- Break before leaving the operating theatre:
  - Oral confirmation by staff to the team:
    - Of the recorded intervention
    - The correct final count of compresses, needles, instruments, etc.
    - Labelling of samples, operating theatres, etc.
    - If any undesirable events or medical risks have occurred: report/notification

- Prescriptions for immediate post-operative care are made jointly by the surgical and anaesthetic teams.

N.B: IADE: state-qualified nurse anaesthetist; IBODE: state-qualified operating theatre nurse; IDE: state-qualified nurse.

**Recovery Barriers**

The mistake has been made but recovered before it has any consequences. For example, the patient is allergic to penicillin, which is the antibiotic prophylaxis prescribed before surgery, but the nurse reads about it in the medical record and alerts the prescriber, who changes the prescription.

**Mitigation Barriers**

The error has been made and has not been recovered. The aim is to limit the consequences for the patient. For example, a patient suffers cardiac arrest as a result of an error in the route of administration made by a nurse. She notifies the senior doctor as soon as she realizes the error. The medical team is on site and starts cardiac massage while the SOS cardiac arrest team called in immediately arrives. The electric shock restored cardiac function, and the patient was transferred to intensive care for stabilization and monitoring. He was discharged the next day.

**Root Cause Analysis**

The root causes of a medical error should be sought in the overall context surrounding the undesirable event. The analysis methods are structured to avoid oversights. The most commonly used methods are the ALARM method and the Orion® method. Root cause analysis methods generally include the following six steps for proper application:

1. Data collection: semi-structured interviews with all the people present at the time of the event, files, any other documents needed to understand the events.
2. Reconstructing the chronology of the event.
3. Identifying deviations from recommended practices, without judging against an existing benchmark.
4. Identification of contributing factors: immediate and deep or root causes.

**Typology of Contributing Factors or Root Causes (According to the ALARM Method)**

Factors may be linked to:
- The patient: state of health, seriousness of associated illnesses, communication difficulties (language, conflict with carers, etc.), vulnerability of certain patient populations (the elderly, patients with chronic illnesses, children, adolescents, people with disabilities, the underprivileged, etc.).
- The tasks to be carried out.
- The team: communication within the team and with the patient in the therapeutic relationship, traceability of information in the patient file, supervision of junior staff undergoing training.
- The working environment: physical (premises, equipment, supplies, etc.) or organizational (availability of qualified human resources, work organization, working hours, etc.).
- Organization and management: policies for replacing absent staff (no replacement, temporary staff, travel), continuous training, equipment management, etc.
- The institutional context: national and regional public health policies, adverse event reporting systems, etc.

5. Proposed actions to be implemented (accompanied by an action plan).
6. Drafting the analysis report.",0.8333333333333334,13.073333333333338,False,True,0.7144425511360168,0.6905829111735026,b,False,2,4

Epidemiology of Cystic Fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, also known as mucoviscidosis, is the most common serious genetic disease among children of European descent. It is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, affecting one in every 4,700 births. Approximately one in 35 individuals is a heterozygous carrier of a CFTR gene mutation. The most common mutation in France is F508del. Life expectancy at birth exceeds 40 years.

**Situations at Risk of Fetal Cystic Fibrosis**

- **Ultrasound Monitoring**

  The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be considered during pregnancy ultrasound monitoring if a hyperechoic bowel is observed. This is a non-specific warning sign that may indicate cystic fibrosis in about 5% of cases. The risk increases if the hyperechoic bowel is accompanied by the absence of gallbladder visualization. A study of the CFTR gene is then conducted in the couple. If mutations are detected in one or both partners, the fetus is tested for these mutations using an amniotic fluid sample.

- **Family History of Cystic Fibrosis**

  Both parents are heterozygous carriers of a CFTR mutation. The risk of transmitting the disease to offspring is 1/4 with each pregnancy. Prenatal diagnosis is possible via chorionic villus sampling from 11 weeks of amenorrhea or by amniocentesis from 16 weeks of amenorrhea. Once fetal DNA is extracted, molecular biology techniques determine the presence or absence of parental CFTR gene mutations. A pre-implantation diagnosis may also be proposed. If heterozygous status is known for only one parent, a comprehensive study of the CFTR gene is required for the other spouse to assess the risk.

- **One Parent Has Cystic Fibrosis**

  A parent with cystic fibrosis will pass on one of the two mutations they carry. It is necessary to determine the spouse's status by conducting a thorough study of the CFTR gene. If the spouse is heterozygous, the risk of transmitting the disease is 1/2, and prenatal or pre-implantation diagnosis is proposed.",0.0,16.25,False,True,0.7761096954345703,0.5774844487508138,c,False,3,3

**Title:** Diagnosing a Primary Headache  
**Description:** How to rule out a secondary headache and specify the type of primary headache.  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

The diagnostic approach is detailed in item 100. In the absence of biological or radiological markers, the diagnosis is clinical, based on questioning using the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) and a normal clinical examination. This involves the assessment and management of acute pain (SD-259), chronic pain (SD-260), and pain in children and infants (SD-261).

**Rule Out a Secondary Headache**

Questioning identifies any acute, recent, and unusual headache, which must be considered secondary and explored rapidly. It looks for red flags that immediately raise suspicion of a serious cause (item 100). A diagnosis of primary headache should not be made during a first episode. The clinical examination is normal in primary headaches, apart from the dysautonomic signs of an AVF attack.

**Specify the Type of Primary Headache**

Once it is established that the patient is consulting for habitual, long-standing headaches (for at least 3 months, often much longer), the questioning takes place in five stages:

1. **Patient Expression**  
   - Predominant symptoms  
   - Main concerns  

2. **Characterize the Headache**  
   - Duration and frequency of attacks, evolution over time  
   - Topography, intensity, type of pain, aggravating or calming factors (dietary, hormonal, emotional)  

3. **Identify Accompanying Signs**  
   - ""Migraine"" symptoms: nausea, vomiting, photo-/phonophobia, pulsatility  
   - Trigemino-autonomic symptoms: lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, ptosis, miosis, eye redness, edema of the eyelid  
   - Behavior during seizures, agitation  
   - Focal symptoms, postural element  

4. **Patient Context**  
   - Antecedents, context, triggers, infections, trauma, travel, psychiatric situation, repercussions on sleep, work, social life, schooling, etc.  
   - Patient expectations and beliefs about the disease  

5. **Review Treatment History**  
   - Crisis and background treatments, length of time taken, dose, effectiveness, side effects, etc.  
   - Frequency of drug use in the last 3 months (look for abuse), effectiveness of treatments  

The clinical examination is normal in primary headaches. The characteristics of the headache help to make the diagnosis (item 100). The temporal profile is very important: duration of attacks without treatment; number of headache days per month; duration of headaches without treatment.

- **Headache < 15 days/month:** The main causes are episodic migraine and episodic tension headache.
- **Headache ≥ 15 days/month:** Chronic daily headache (CCQ). A distinction is made between:
  - Short-term CCQ (attacks <4 hours): facial vascular algesia and trigeminal neuralgia.
  - Long-term CCQ (>4 hours): chronic migraine or, more rarely, chronic tension headache, both with or without drug abuse.

**Description:** Taking account of the patient's individual situation to adjust the benefit/risk ratio for prescribing purposes

**Rubric:** Management

Prescribing a drug must consider the patient's individual situation and requires knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug, as well as a comparison with the patient's physiology, particularly age, weight, and the functional capacity of the main purifying organs. This individual assessment should be carried out systematically before any initial prescription or prescription renewal to assess the ""benefit/risk ratio"" and should continue throughout the prescription period.

== Pre-therapeutic Assessment ==
Before any prescription is given, the patient must be assessed based on:

- **Demographic characteristics:** Age (extreme ages may require treatment adaptation), weight (extreme weights can impact drug pharmacokinetics), and ethnic origin (certain genetic polymorphisms may lead to treatment restrictions or adaptations).
- **Medical history:** Any allergies and intercurrent pathologies that may contraindicate certain drugs.
- **Assessment of major drug purification functions:** Evaluation of renal function (estimate of glomerular filtration rate) and liver function (presence and severity of hepatocellular insufficiency).
- **Current drug treatments:** Already prescribed medications and/or self-medicated drugs, which may need adaptation depending on the risk of drug interaction.

== Therapeutic Objective ==
The prescriber must establish a therapeutic objective in a concerted manner with the patient, based on objective factors that enable assessment of this objective. These include:

- For curative treatment, measurable or perceived improvements in the patient's condition.
- For preventive treatment, reliance on public health data indicating a reduction in the risk of an event.

== Definition of the Individual Benefit/Risk Ratio ==
The prescriber must assess the benefit and risk of the drug prescription according to scientific data, mainly from phase III and IV therapeutic trials. This report is evolving for a medicinal product in a given indication and must be frequently re-evaluated based on new scientific information. The benefit/risk ratio must be considered in terms of the patient's individual situation, including specific benefits and risks in the population subgroup to which the patient belongs.

== Choice of Treatment ==
These factors should help determine the appropriate drug(s) as part of a treatment tailored to the individual patient. The selection criteria are based on:

- **Authorisation de mise sur le marché (AMM):** The medicinal product's market authorization for a precise indication. Prescription outside the scope of the MA can only be exceptional and must follow strict conditions defined in article L. 5121-12-1 of the French Public Health Code.
- **Level of evidence:** The drug's efficacy in the indication in question. The choice between two medicinal products for the same indication should be guided by the highest level of evidence, and where equal, preference should be given to the product with the greatest experience of use.
- **Pre-therapeutic assessment, therapeutic objective, and individual benefit-risk ratio:** Previously established for this patient.

== Treatment Evaluation ==
Once the prescription is made, provision must be made for monitoring the treatment, and the prescriber must evaluate the treatment on an ongoing basis. This evaluation covers:

- **Efficacy of the treatment:** Consistency with the therapeutic objective defined above.
- **Safety profile assessment:** Focus on the main adverse reaction signals detected during therapeutic trials and pharmacovigilance monitoring.
- **Drug monitoring:** Based on clinical data (e.g., blood pressure measurement for antihypertensive drugs), biological data (e.g., blood sugar monitoring for diabetes treatment), and pharmacovigilance data, including pharmacological therapeutic monitoring (e.g., measurement of blood concentrations of immunosuppressants in the context of organ transplantation rejection prevention).

These elements of treatment evaluation enable the ""benefit-risk ratio"" to be reassessed throughout the prescription period and may require the drug to be adapted or discontinued depending on changes in the ratio.",1.0,15.030000000000001,False,True,0.7630746960639954,0.6683459083239237,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Definition of Maternal-Fetal Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection

**Rubric:** Definition

Maternal CMV infection is the first cause of congenital viral infection and the first non-hereditary cause of sensorineural hearing loss and mental retardation in early childhood.

Maternal-fetal transmission is possible in the periconceptional period (1 month before to 3 weeks after the start of pregnancy: 15% risk).

The overall transmission rate during pregnancy averages 40%. It increases with gestational age (36% in the 1st trimester, 40% in the 2nd, 65% in the 3rd).

Among infected children:
- 10% will develop a severe prenatal infection (intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, hydrocephaly, intracranial calcifications, fetal death in utero) ""Anomaly of psychomotor development (SD-115)""
- 10% are apparently healthy at birth but will have neurosensory sequelae (deafness in particular)
- 80% will have an asymptomatic form

Maternal reinfections also expose the child to these risks, although less frequently.

Severity is correlated with term: lower risk of transmission at the beginning of pregnancy but more severe forms.

In the event of maternal infection, the patient should be referred to a prenatal diagnosis center to discuss management (antiviral/amniocentesis/ultrasound/MRI).

The use of high-dose valaciclovir could reduce the risk of congenital infection for infections in the 1st trimester of pregnancy when introduced rapidly.

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections of the skin and mucous membranes are very common. In the skin, they cause benign epithelial lesions, such as warts, and in the mucous membranes, condylomas.

Warts affect 7 to 10% of the general population, with a peak in frequency between the ages of 10 and 14.

**Common Clinical Aspects of Warts:**

- **Plantar Warts:** There are two anatomo-clinical varieties:
  - **Myrmecia (HPV1):** The most common type, characterized by deep warts that are painful on pressure, single or multiple. These are circumscribed by a thick keratotic ring partially covering the central region, which has a keratotic and papillomatous surface dotted with black dots (thrombosed capillaries).
  - **Mosaic Warts (HPV2):** Less common (1/4 of plantar warts), these are superficial, painless warts in keratotic plaques.

- **Common Vulgar Warts (HPV2):** Exophytic lesions with a surface bristling with greyish keratotic projections and occasional crevices. They vary in size and number and can sometimes be confluent. These are primarily localized on the dorsal surface of the hands and fingers, and more rarely on the palms or other cutaneous locations.

- **Common Flat Warts (HPV3):** Small, barely raised papules, yellow or buff in color, with a smooth or finely mamelinated surface. They occur mainly on the face, back of the hands, and limbs. Usually, they resolve in less than two years but can be chronic in immunocompromised patients.

**Treatment of Warts:**

- There is no specific treatment for HPV infections.
- Patients should be informed that these lesions are benign, there is a high risk of recurrence, and warts usually regress spontaneously. Therefore, warts should not be treated aggressively.
- Destruction (on request, on a case-by-case basis, depending on experience) can be performed using chemical keratolytics (salicylic acid-based preparations with protection of peripheral healthy skin) or physical cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen.",1.0,10.562500000000004,False,True,0.720825731754303,0.8151198228200277,c,True,3,4

**Epidemiology/Physiopathology/Natural Evolution**

- Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause, but infectious mononucleosis (IM) can also be associated with CMV, HIV, or toxoplasmosis (see mononucleosis syndrome).
- EBV belongs to the Herpesviridae family, subfamily gamma-herpesvirinae, genus lymphocryptovirus.
- Human-to-human transmission occurs via the respiratory route (saliva).
- The preferred age for primary infection is adolescence, but it can occur in younger children (acute or prolonged fever) or in adults.
- 80-90% of adults are immunized (in France and wealthy countries).
- There is a possibility of asymptomatic reactivation in immunocompetent patients and symptomatic reactivation in immunocompromised patients (transplants).

**Clinical Features**

- Incubation period is 4 to 6 weeks.
- Prolonged contagiousness after infection due to salivary excretion.
- The typical clinical picture includes a fever of variable intensity, which may be prolonged, significant asthenia, pseudomembranous angina, cervical polyadenopathy, but other territories may be affected, often with splenomegaly.
- The rash is inconstant, maculopapular, and favored by ampicillin use. Facial edema may be present.
- Other signs and symptoms may include hepatomegaly, hepatalgia, and more rarely jaundice.
- EBV infection can also present as a prolonged fever, particularly in young children.
- Symptoms vary in duration, and adolescents may experience marked asthenia.

**Biologically**

- Mononucleosis syndrome (Leukocyte abnormality SD-216), sometimes thrombocytopenia.
- Frequent hepatic cytolysis.
- Diagnosis is based on serology and the presence of anti-VCA IgM without anti-EBNA IgG.

**Complications/Seriousness**

- Obstructive ENT issues linked to tonsillar and adenoid hypertrophy, with rare but possible superinfection: sinuses, middle ear, cavum.
- Rarer complications include cardiac (myocarditis and pericarditis), hematological (hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia), and neurological (lymphocytic meningitis, meningoencephalitis).
- In immunocompromised patients: lymphoproliferative syndrome.
- In predisposed individuals (Purtilo syndrome): monocytomacrophagic activation syndrome.
- EBV is also a risk factor for Burkitt's lymphoma.

**Differential Diagnoses**

- Other infections:
  - Bacterial: Scarlet fever (erythematopulmonary angina), exceptional diphtheria (extensive pseudomembranous angina).
  - Viral: CMV (no angina), primary HIV infection (caution with adolescents).
  - Parasitic: Toxoplasmosis (cervical adenopathy, sometimes general signs).
- Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (particularly DRESS).
- Lymphoma (polyadenopathies).

The intensity of the clinical signs depends on the severity of the thyrotoxicosis, its duration, and the patient's condition. It is the combination of several disorders that prompts the diagnosis.

The main signs and symptoms associated with thyrotoxicosis in adults are:

- Agitation (SD-114) and sleep disorders
- Tachycardia (SD-166) at rest, regular, sinusoidal, with possible palpitations (SD-165)
- Asthenia (SD-021)
- Tremors
- Weight loss (SD-017) with preserved appetite
- Thermophobia, often accompanied by hypersudation (SD-025), sometimes with polydipsia
- Sometimes dyspnoea (SD-162) on exertion
- Muscular weakness leading to muscular fatigability (SD-074), which can result in amyotrophy, especially in the elderly
- Diarrhea (SD-002)

The ophthalmological signs are specific to Graves' disease and, apart from the glare which may occur regardless of the cause of the excess thyroid hormones, are observed in Graves' disease. They are mainly:

- Retraction of the upper eyelid uncovering the iris, with oculopalpebral asynergy and sometimes conjunctival redness

The standard treatment for type 1 diabetes is intensified insulin therapy: injection of slow-acting insulin and several injections of rapid-acting insulin each day, or use of an insulin pump. Prescription of insulin therapy, follow-up consultation, and education of a type 1 diabetic patient (SD-280).

Intensified insulin therapy reduces glycated haemoglobin and delays and reduces the severity of micro- and macroangiopathic complications. It does, however, increase the risk of severe hypoglycaemia.

The objectives of treatment are a compromise between ensuring the freest possible life and preventing acute or chronic complications of the disease.

Therapeutic education is necessary to empower patients in the self-management of their disease and must take into account the experiences of patients and their families.

**Description:** Organization of Care

**Rubric:** Definition

The Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM) manages the risks of sickness, maternity, disability, and death, as well as accidents at work and occupational diseases. Its main mission is to ""pay for the care provided to insured persons."" It also contributes to improving the health of the population, the efficiency of the healthcare system, and the control of healthcare expenditure. To fulfill its missions, health insurance has several levers of intervention including:

- Definition of the ""scope of reimbursable procedures"" based on medical recommendations and opinions issued by the French National Authority for Health (HAS)
- Pricing of procedures and level of reimbursement: common classification of medical procedures (CCAM), activity-based pricing (T2A) for health establishments, and general nomenclature of professional procedures

Within the framework of the Union Nationale des Caisses d'Assurance Maladie (UNCAM), which groups together the national health insurance schemes (the general scheme and the MSA), it conducts the ""conventionnelle policy"" (relations between health professionals and the health insurance scheme, in particular the tariffs for procedures including consultations).

The health insurance scheme contributes to better matching of healthcare provision to the needs of insured persons within the framework of the regional health agencies, informing insured persons about the characteristics of local healthcare provision and the proper use of healthcare products. It participates in the prevention policy (cancer screening) and develops a support system for patients with serious pathologies (monitoring diabetic patients as part of the Sophia programme, for example).

Sickness insurance contributes to the dissemination of HAS recommendations to professionals (carried out by sickness insurance delegates) and draws up comparative profiles of activity and prescriptions.

Finally, the health insurance scheme is responsible for the medical control of expenditure. Within each region, the health insurance scheme participates in the development, under the aegis of the ARS, of a regional multi-annual risk management programme which complements the national risk management programmes.",0.4,10.723333333333333,False,True,0.7515509128570557,0.6824158032735189,b,False,4,3

**Rubric:** Management

Four areas: 1) hygiene care, 2) local anti-inflammatory treatment, 3) emollients, 4) therapeutic education.

### 1) Non-aggressive hygiene care for cleansing and avoidance of aggravating factors:
- Use a mild, unscented soap-free gel instead of soap.
- Reduce the frequency of washing skin (once every 2 days or once a day).
- Avoid prolonged hot baths.
- Apply an emollient after washing on non-inflammatory skin.
- Favor soft textiles and avoid wool.
- Do not overheat the home and avoid over-covering children, as home heating may aggravate the condition.

### 2) Local anti-inflammatory treatment: Dermocorticoids
Dermocorticoids (DC) have anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and antimitotic actions. They are effective in the short term against atopic dermatitis (AD) flare-ups, though long-term efficacy studies are rare. DCs are classified by potency (very strong, strong, moderate, weak) and form (cream, ointment, lotion, gel).

**Choice of DC depends on four criteria:** age, location of lesions, extent to be treated, and oozing nature of lesions.

**Choice of galenical:**
- Ointment for dry, lichenified skin areas.
- Cream for oozing areas, folds, and large skin surfaces.
- Lotion for hairy areas and folds (rarely used on children).
- Scalp gel (rarely used in children).

**Choice of activity level:**
- Very strong DCs are contraindicated for infants, young children, and on the face, folds, and seat.
- High-activity DCs in short courses (4 to 7 days) are indicated for children on lichenified lesions, extremities, and lesions resistant to moderate-activity DCs.
- Moderate-activity DCs are used on the face and body of infants and children.
- Low-activity DCs are not recommended due to low efficacy.

**Number of applications per day:**
A single application per day is as effective as multiple applications and aids treatment adherence.

**Quantity to be applied:**
No maximum quantity is recommended during initial treatment. Maintenance treatment should not exceed 30 g/month of moderate-activity DC for children and 60 g/month for adults. Using a strong dermocorticoid twice a week on usually affected areas for 4 months can reduce flare-ups without side effects, suitable for chronic AD with frequent flare-ups.

### 3) Emollients
Emollients improve skin dryness and temporarily restore the skin's barrier function. Their use is recommended from the first symptoms of skin dryness and as maintenance treatment throughout AD, regardless of severity.

**Precautions for use:**
- Interrupt use during highly inflammatory flare-ups due to poor tolerance.
- Adapt galenics to patient preferences.
- Use fragrance-free and preservative-free products to avoid contact sensitization. Note: Emollients are not reimbursed by health insurance, except for atopiclair®, generics of dexeryl© (reimbursable at 15%), and magistral preparations reimbursed in the absence of an available equivalent.

### 4) Therapeutic education
The aim is to teach patients to live optimally with a chronic disease. It involves providing information and learning techniques by healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, psychologists) through consultations and/or small group meetings. The goal is to help patients and families become more independent, adhere to treatment, and combat corticophobia.

**Other treatments:**
- Oral antihistamines (anti-H1): No proven efficacy on pruritus in the acute phase, except for hydroxyzine, a sedative anti-H1, during flare-ups in young children with sleep disorders.
- Topical immunomodulator: Tacrolimus (in France) is indicated for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis flare-ups in children and adults where dermocorticoids are resistant or contraindicated (especially facial lesions).
- Systemic treatments for severe forms: phototherapy, cyclosporine, dupilumab, JAK inhibitors. General corticosteroid therapy is not indicated due to the risk of rebound upon discontinuation.",1.0,14.445454545454545,False,True,0.7467840909957886,0.6950896581013998,a,False,2,4

**Title:** Know the Principles of Treating Hyponatremia According to the Severity of Symptoms

**Description:** Evaluate the degree of urgency according to the clinical symptoms, know the principles of water restriction, and correction rules (rhythm and strategy of possible osmolar supplements).

**Rubric:** Management

**Treatment of Hyponatremia:**

- Includes aetiological treatment and symptomatic treatment, which consists of reducing excess water.
- The amount of excess water is estimated using the formula: Excess Water = 60% × weight × ([Natremia/140] - 1).

**In Chronic Hyponatremia, Priority Should Be Given to:**

- Etiological treatment (e.g., discontinuation of a drug, treatment of a cause of SIADH).
- Fluid restriction (500 mL/day) is always recommended and allows hyponatremia to be gradually corrected over several days.
- Associated symptomatic treatment, which depends on the state of the extracellular sector:
  - In the event of associated extracellular dehydration, additional NaCl intake (orally or with isotonic saline solution at 9 g/L, 0.5 to 1L/h).
  - In cases of extracellular euvolaemia due to SIADH, hyponatremia may be corrected by fluid restriction alone. If the dilution disorder is very marked (very high OsmU), fluid restriction alone may be insufficient. In this case:
    - Adding osmoles by administering urea orally (0.25 to 0.50 g/kg diluted in orange juice).
    - If these approaches fail, the use of a specific V2 ADH receptor antagonist (tolvaptan 15 to 60 mg/day orally) may be discussed if the hyponatremia is chronic and after specialist advice.
    - In cases of extracellular euvolaemia with imbalance in water intake vs. osmoles (""tea and toast"" syndrome), water restriction and/or increased osmole intake (animal proteins, NaCl) are generally sufficient.
  - In cases of associated extracellular hyperhydration: sodium restriction and loop diuretics.

**Rate of Correction:**

- The rate of correction of hyponatremia must not exceed 10 mmol/L/day for the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L for the following 24 hours (a total of 18 mmol/L over 48 hours).

**In Emergency Cases of Severe Hyponatremia (Na < 120 mOsm/kg H2O):**

- Whether acute or chronic, and responsible for moderate to severe symptoms (consciousness disorders, comitiveness, vomiting), the following regimen may be proposed:
  - Rapid infusion of hypertonic NaCl (3% NaCl 150 mL IV over 20 min, renewable 2 times depending on the control natremia), with the initial aim of increasing the natremia by 5 mmol/L.
  - NaCl 9 ‰ (if blood volume is reduced and urinary osmolality is below 300-350 mOsm/Kg) may then be administered, with the aim of not exceeding +10 mmol/L natremia in the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L over the following 24 hours (i.e., ≤ 18 mmol/L over 48 hours) until 130 mmol/L is reached.
  - Monitoring in an intensive care unit is essential, as is the correction of any hypoxia.
  - In a second phase, treatment reverts to that of asymptomatic hyponatremia.
  - Associated hypokalaemia must be corrected (with KCl). This increases the risk of rapid correction of the natremia, particularly in patients with initial volume depletion (treatment with thiazides).",0.29411764705882354,13.62344827586207,False,False,0.761441707611084,0.6724034349123637,a,False,3,4

**Description:** None  

Mechanical prostheses require long-term curative anticoagulation. Only VKAs are recommended. The effectiveness of anticoagulation is assessed by measuring the INR. INR monitoring is therefore essential, given the risk of prosthesis thrombosis and the serious consequences of such thrombosis.

The INR should be measured in the laboratory at least once a month, and more regularly if necessary (fluctuating INR, clinical situations causing biological changes). Recently, the CoaguChek® INRange system enables patients to measure their INR themselves at home, which means more regular monitoring. It is now reimbursed for adult patients with mechanical prostheses.

The INR target is defined by cardiologists on an individual basis. The type of prosthesis, the position of the prosthesis, and the risk factors must be taken into account:

| Thrombotic Risk of the Prosthesis | No Risk Factors | ≥ 1 Risk Factor |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Low                               | 2.5             | 3.0             |

**Definitions**

A urological cause should always be ruled out in the case of isolated macroscopic hematuria or persistent microscopic hematuria before any nephrological work-up. Stress hematuria remains a diagnosis of elimination (most often microscopic, sometimes linked to a stone), and the use of anticoagulants can encourage hematuria but should always lead to a search for an underlying etiology, such as a tumor.

**Rubric:** Diagnosis  

**Definitions**

Prematurity is defined as birth before 37 weeks' amenorrhea (SA) and, from 22 SA, of a child weighing at least 500g.

A distinction is traditionally made between spontaneous prematurity (occurring spontaneously, without medical intervention or escaping tocolytic treatment) and induced prematurity (induced labor or cesarean section). In France, half of premature births are due to spontaneous prematurity (spontaneous labor or premature rupture of the membranes) and the other half to induced prematurity.

Spontaneous prematurity occurs after spontaneous labor with intact membranes (e.g., uterine contraction in a pregnant woman, pelvic pain) or after premature rupture of the membranes (e.g., loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman). Induced prematurity is linked to a fetal or maternal pathology leading voluntarily to birth through medical intervention.

The main causes of induced prematurity are pre-eclampsia (e.g., hypertension during pregnancy and proteinuria), IUGR, hypertension during pregnancy, retroplacental hematoma, and maternal pathologies requiring the birth of the child (e.g., respiratory insufficiency, acute respiratory distress, decompensated heart disease).

Patients with preterm rupture of membranes may also have an induced delivery if the condition of the newborn or the mother requires induction of labor or a cesarean section. There are many risk factors for spontaneous prematurity.

**Risk Factors**

- **Socio-demographic Risk Factors:**
  - Single, low socio-economic level (e.g., precarious social situation and isolation), inconsistent follow-up
  - Tobacco, alcohol, drugs
  - Stress, anxiety, depression, prolonged standing job
  - History of premature delivery and late miscarriage
  - Short interval between last two pregnancies
  - IVF (e.g., difficulty having children)

- **Risk Factors for Prematurity Linked to the Uterine Environment:**
  - Amnio-chorion infection
  - In the event of early premature rupture of the membranes, the risk of amnio-chorion infection is greatly increased.
  - Uterine malformations (e.g., discovery of a genital tract malformation)
  - Cervico-isthmic incompetence (classically defined as a functional mechanical disorder of the cervix resulting in late miscarriage)
  - Conization
  - Placental anomaly (placenta inserted low)
  - Breakthrough bleeding
