**Title:** Great principles of medical ethics  
**Description:** Know how to define and identify the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy, and justice. Understand the obligations of proportionality and competence.  
**Rubric:** Definition  

To study ethical issues, we need tools and rules for analysis and debate.

**I. The Principles Approach**

The principles approach, proposed by Professors Tom L. Beauchamp and James F. Childress in 1979, is particularly useful for thinking in the context of healthcare practices and has been well-received in the medical community. This principles-based analysis, known as principalism, involves studying the ethical issues in medical practice or healthcare organization from the perspective of four major principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy, and justice.

**Beneficence and Non-maleficence**

Beneficence and non-maleficence originate from the medical tradition. In its Hippocratic conception, the caregiver-patient relationship is based on Aristotelian morality and ""Primum non nocere."" Historically, medical action aimed at doing good by refraining from harm refers to the principle of beneficence. This principle suggests that what is advantageous for a patient must be achieved. It presupposes that medical action is inherently good, medically validated, and proven beneficial. However, as the benefit/risk balance may be uncertain, the principle of beneficence must be supplemented by the principle of non-maleficence, considering the risk of harming a patient.

**Autonomy**

The principle of autonomy derives from seventeenth-century philosophy, prefiguring the Enlightenment. Ren√© Descartes asserted the sovereignty of the mind over the body as a condition of freedom. Autonomy is understood as the individual's freedom to decide on preferences through internal deliberation based on analytical capacity. It is regulated by a social contract, as described by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, where individuals acquire rights within the common law framework, favoring freedom of thought, belief, and choice of destiny.

In healthcare, patient autonomy was often ignored, with decisions made without patient consent. This paternalistic attitude has shifted since the 1970s, with a demand for patient involvement in decisions. According to philosopher Tore Nilstun, paternalism involves treating others according to what you consider their good, often disregarding their preferences. Today, recognizing patient autonomy involves shared decision-making, requiring healthcare providers to inform and consider patient questions, wishes, and values. However, autonomy is not absolute, as it may be limited by the patient's capacity or conflicting values within the healthcare system.

**Justice**

The principle of justice is a collective ideal that varies across societies. In healthcare, justice is understood in terms of non-discrimination, universality, access to healthcare for all, and solidarity. It is a broad concept with a strong moral dimension based on respect for the individual, but it also presents ethical tensions. Debates may arise about limiting access to expensive treatments or responding to requests for collective solidarity. Justice involves democratic choices, redistributive justice, and addressing inequalities. It also involves balancing rights and duties, ensuring professional responsibility, and acting in accordance with societal rules.

**II. In Practice**

The ethics of the principles approach involves questioning each principle, particularly beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy, and justice. This approach does not preclude adding other principles, nor does it require all four principles to be respected in every decision. Instead, it involves systematically questioning them to understand why and how they might not all be respected and how they compensate for each other.

A decision may be acceptable if one principle is compromised but offset by the strength of the others. For example, the loss of autonomy may be acceptable if the action is beneficial, not harmful, and just. Philosophers like Emmanuel Levinas and Hans Jonas emphasize beneficence and responsibility for others, advocating for action that supports those losing autonomy. This action should be carried out with mutual understanding and dignified support, seeking not consent but a path towards agreement. In principalism, each principle is a point for debate, with any transgression or adaptation requiring ethical validation.",0.9375,21.965000000000007,False,True,0.7540310621261597,0.595956285794576,c,False,2,4

**Title:** Intentional termination of pregnancy  
**Rubric:** Management  

Voluntary interruption of pregnancy has been a recognized right in France since the 1975 Veil law. Every year, hundreds of thousands of women have recourse to it (see item 37 ""Voluntary termination of pregnancy"").

== 1) This right illustrates the ethic of responsibility of the medical profession ==  
Regardless of the value judgment made about a woman's wish to terminate her pregnancy, moral convictions about the value of fetal life, or views about the psychological impact of a procedure that is certainly not harmless, the 1975 law provided a medical framework for a practice that was both frequent and risky, as not all women were on the same footing. The law made it possible to guarantee equal and safe access to this procedure.

In other words, whether we consider that the right to abortion is a natural consequence of women's freedom, or whether we question it in terms of principles and conceptions of human life, we can agree that it is first and foremost a ""public health"" policy.

== 2) This right illustrates a compromise between different moral conceptions of procreation ==  
Some ""pro-life"" movements see abortion as the equivalent of infanticide. But when does the life of a human being begin? Only at birth? From the moment of conception? Or even before, when the plan to raise a child takes shape? Or why not even after birth, through various rites (registration, presentation to the family, baptisms, etc.)?

The question of the beginning of human life remains contentious, with philosophical and religious traditions responding in different ways, often with a degree of ambiguity. The beginning of life has always been socially negotiated (traditionally through the visible signs of pregnancy). Nor is biology able to draw a clear line on the continuum between a simple cluster of cells and a human being. Even the criterion of fetal viability depends on the context and the technical resources available.

Under these conditions, the right to abortion is a balance between consideration for the individual and respect for life. As stated in article 16 of the Civil Code, ""the law ensures the primacy of the person, prohibits any attack on his dignity and guarantees respect for the human being from the beginning of his life"". However, the living embryo has no legal status. The Comit√© Consultatif National d'√âthique describes it as a ""potential human person"", which makes it possible to avoid granting it rights (which would be enforceable against the woman carrying it) while still showing it consideration and respect. This compromise, developed over the last few decades, provides a balanced framework at the crossroads of different visions of the world and of human life.

== 3) Effective access to this right is a serious ethical issue ==  
In the face of various kinds of ""slippery slope"" arguments (e.g., that abortion would lead to eugenics), the Veil law initially introduced safeguards designed to limit excessive or abusive recourse to abortion. For example, there was a 7-day reflection period imposed on women between the first consultation for an abortion and the procedure itself. This constraint came to be seen not only as an unnecessary complication but also as infantilizing women by casting suspicion on their autonomy. During the debate that led to the vote to abolish the cooling-off period in 2017, the French Health Minister said: ""The relationship with abortion has not been trivialized, it has been normalized. A woman who has made up her mind doesn't need time"".

Similarly, the conscience clause that healthcare professionals can invoke is regulated. Of course, ""a doctor or midwife is never obliged to carry out a voluntary interruption of pregnancy"" (Article L2212-8 of the French Public Health Code). However, any professional who refuses to do so must immediately put the woman concerned in touch with other professionals. In this way, the conscience clause must not stand in the way of access to this right.

Some individuals and organizations have set themselves the goal of obstructing access to abortion by various means, for example by disseminating false information, intimidating healthcare professionals, and putting pressure on healthcare establishments. The ""offense of hindering abortion"", which has existed since 1993, was clarified and extended in 2017, and these acts are subject to severe penalties. At the same time, initiatives have been taken by the public authorities to provide access to reliable information (toll-free number 0800 08 11 11; Official website https://ivg.gouv.fr/).

The fact remains that ""effective"" access to abortion for all women who want it, wherever they are, remains fragile. All the more so as the very principle of this right is far from being recognized everywhere, and is even being called into question in countries where it seemed to have been taken for granted (as the recent example of the United States has shown).",0.8888888888888888,18.525263157894738,False,True,0.7680455446243286,0.7018338640530905,b,False,2,4

## Examination in Ophthalmology

### 1. Interrogation

### 2. Measurement of Visual Acuity
The measurement of visual acuity, coupled with a study of refraction, is carried out separately for each eye at two observation distances (far and near).

### 3. Examination of the Anterior Segment by Biomicroscopy
Biomicroscopy (slit lamp) enables examination of the conjunctiva, cornea, iris, anterior chamber, and lens.

### 4. Measuring Eye Pressure
This is done using an applanation tonometer fitted to the slit lamp or a forced-air tonometer.

### 5. Gonioscopy
An examination carried out with a slit lamp using a contact lens with a mirror to assess the various elements of the iridocorneal angle.

### 6. Examination of the Back of the Eye
- **Direct Biomicroscopy:** Provides a straight image of the back of the eye with a reduced field of view, not allowing vision of relief (method used by internists).
- **Indirect Biomicroscopy:** Carried out with a slit lamp using a lens, gives an inverted image of the back of the eye, allowing vision of relief and an extended field of observation.

### 7. Examination of Oculomotricity
This examination assesses the six oculomotor muscles of each eye separately (ductions) and in combination (versions).

### 8. Additional Examinations

#### A. Visual Field (Perimetry)
The visual field is the portion of space encompassed by the eye looking straight ahead and motionless. The examination studies sensitivity to light within this space by assessing perception of light tests of varying intensity and size.  
- **Kinetic Perimetry:** Suitable for exploring peripheral deficits, such as hemianopsia and quadranopsia. It is the examination method of choice in neuro-ophthalmology.
- **Static Perimetry:** Mainly indicated for optic nerve pathology, particularly for diagnosing and monitoring chronic glaucoma. Initial alterations to the visual field are very localized and central.

#### B. Colour Vision
Useful for assessing dyschromatopsia in two circumstances:
1. Detecting congenital anomalies, such as daltonism, using coloured charts (e.g., Ishihara chart).
2. In the presence of acquired ocular conditions. The Farnsworth test is used, where the patient classifies coloured tablets. This study aids in diagnosing certain retinal disorders and optic neuropathies and is essential for monitoring treatments likely to cause retinopathy or optic neuropathy (e.g., synthetic anti-malarials, ethambutol, and isoniazid).

#### C. Fundus Angiography
Involves taking images of the fundus after intravenous injection of a fluorescent dye, either fluorescein or indocyanine green.  
- **Fluorescein Angiography:** Provides a dynamic study of retinal vascularization.
- **Indocyanine Green Injection:** Mainly used to visualize pathological choroidal vessels (e.g., vascularization of a choroidal angioma, choroidal neovessels during age-related macular degeneration).

#### D. Electrophysiological Investigations
1. **Electroretinogram (ERG):** Records the retinal action potential secondary to light stimulation using a corneal electrode. Reflects a global response of the retina, altered in extensive retinal lesions (e.g., hereditary retinal dystrophies).
2. **Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs):** Represent action potentials in the occipital cortex following light stimulation of the retina, exploring the optic pathways from the ganglion cell to the occipital cortex. Useful in diagnosing optic neuropathies, particularly in multiple sclerosis.
3. **Electro-oculogram (EOG):** Measures the activity of the pigment epithelium.

#### E. Ultrasound
- **A-mode Ultrasound:** Assesses the length of the eyeball.
- **B-mode Ultrasound:** Detects retinal detachment in ocular media disorders, locates intraocular foreign bodies, or aids in diagnosing intraocular or intraorbital tumors.

#### F. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
Used to obtain high-precision slices of the retina. Main applications include studying macular disorders (e.g., premacular membrane, macular hole, macular oedema), visualizing and localizing choroidal neovessels, and screening for chronic glaucoma by revealing optic fiber loss.

#### G. Complementary Examinations of the Anterior Segment
- **Corneal Topography:** Gathers information about the curvature or relief of the cornea, analyzing the reflection of a light pattern. Used for analyzing astigmatism, particularly in searching for keratoconus.
- **Biometry:** Combines measurements of corneal curvature (keratometry) and anterior-posterior (axial) length of the eye using an optical device. Used to calculate implant power in cataract surgery.",0.7142857142857143,21.16222222222223,False,True,0.7337646484375,0.6766149997711182,c,False,5,3

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder with complete penetrance, linked to an expansion (abnormally high number) of CAG triplets on the ""HTT"" gene encoding the huntingtin protein on chromosome 4, detected by genetic analysis. The higher the number of CAG triplets, the earlier and more severe the onset of the disease.

**Clinical Signs:**

- Abnormal movements, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive impairment.
- The abnormal movements are primarily chorea, which spreads progressively and can affect the hands, feet, face, and trunk. As the disease progresses, dystonic abnormal movements and a parkinsonian syndrome may be encountered.
- Psychiatric disorders often involve mood (sad mood, moral pain) and/or behavior initially corresponding to a change in personality, disinhibition, depression, anxiety, sometimes a suicide attempt, or psychosis (delusional ideas, rare hallucinations).
- Associated with this is a subcortical-frontal cognitive decline with a dysexecutive syndrome progressing to dementia. Apathy (lack of interest and motivation) and anosognosia are frequent.

There is usually a family history. There are sporadic forms, which can be misleading in cases of early death of one of the parents (censorship), false paternity, or anticipation.

This condition involves the announcement of a chronic illness and the announcement of a serious illness to the patient and/or family. The patient inevitably dies, with progressive loss of autonomy, a situation of disability, grabatisation, dementia with speech and swallowing disorders.

**Description:** None

**Definitions**

No systematic complementary examination is indicated in a chronic constipated person consulting for the first time, in the absence of warning signs.

**Endoscopic Examination: Colonoscopy**

Colonoscopy with general anaesthetic should be offered in the following situations:

- If the symptoms appear or worsen after the age of 50.
- In the event of warning signs (rectal discharge, change in general condition, recent unexplained change in transit).
- In situations recommended as part of systematic screening for colon cancer in the general population (e.g., first-degree family history of colon cancer).

**Biological Tests**

There is no consensus, and no biological test is strictly necessary in the diagnosis of constipation. Their prescription will therefore be guided by the clinical context and especially if there are warning signs.

If a biological check-up is prescribed, it will include: blood count, C-reactive protein, TSH, blood glucose, creatinine, blood ionogram, blood calcium.

**Functional Examinations**

- **Colonic Transit Time Using Radio-Opaque Markers**: This examination is based on an unprepared abdomen X-ray after ingestion of radiopaque markers for 5 to 6 days to assess their number and distribution on the colonic frame. A formula is used to calculate the colonic transit time (normal is around 60 hours). This examination is simple and minimally invasive. However, it has low sensitivity and high inter- and intra-individual variability. It should be carried out after laxatives have been stopped.

- **Anorectal Manometry**: The aim of this examination is to identify a functional disorder of exoneration. Dyschezia, a clinical symptom, may show up in anorectal manometry as abdomino-perineal asynergy (or asynchronism), i.e., the absence of relaxation or even paradoxical contraction of the external anal sphincter when pushing. It is usually performed without prior preparation, in a conscious patient lying on their left side. The principle is to use a probe introduced via the anal route and topped by a balloon.

**Morphological Examinations**

- **Defecography**: The aim of this dynamic radiological examination is to look for an anatomical disorder causing dyschezia (problems with pelvic statics). It involves opacifying the rectum and, more often than not, the urinary and gynaecological tracts, and performing pushing movements. It is most often carried out when conservative treatments have failed and surgery is being considered.

- **Defeco-MRI or Dynamic Pelvic MRI**: This examination is an alternative to defecography and the choice between the two examinations depends on the centres and the habits of the medical and surgical teams.

Consider the time to onset of action before retreating the patient and assess previous treatment effects to avoid delayed cumulative effects on alertness. Monitor adverse effects on alertness and vital functions, as well as efficacy.

Classes used: benzodiazepines, antipsychotics

- **Non-psychiatric or Unknown Etiology**  
  Treatment targeting the etiology is curative. Sometimes, psychotropic treatment may be combined for symptomatic purposes: short half-life benzodiazepines as first-line treatment, antipsychotics in severe agitation cases, preferably after an ECG (risk of long QT).

- **Psychiatric Etiology**  
  Symptomatic treatment of agitation initially: short half-life benzodiazepines first-line, antipsychotics in severe agitation cases, preferably after ECG (risk of long QT). Specific treatment for the psychiatric disorder will follow a diagnostic and pre-therapeutic assessment.

=== Non-pharmacological Treatments ===

==== Systematic Relationship Management ====

- Verbal contact to establish trust and a therapeutic alliance.
- Empathetic behavior.
- De-escalation techniques.
- Environment: quiet, well-lit room, removal of dangerous objects, closing of windows, etc.

==== Physical or Mechanical Restraint ====  
Used as a last resort if other strategies fail or if there is imminent and significant danger to the patient or others. They can aggravate agitation and confusion and cause psychological trauma. Always combined with pharmacological treatment and limited to the time needed for drug efficacy. Accompanied by clear and repeated information on the objectives of the restraint, its duration, regular monitoring of vitals, vigilance, and medical surveillance.

== Acute Delirium ==  
The management of acute delirium is similar to that of agitation:

- Psychiatric hospitalization after ruling out a non-psychiatric diagnosis.
- Prevention of acts against self or others.
- Pharmacological treatment of anxiety and, where appropriate, agitation.
- Non-pharmacological treatment: reassuring relational support.",0.8571428571428571,15.334117647058822,False,True,0.8032784461975098,0.6868058840433756,b,False,4,2

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

**Definitions**

- Before puberty and after the age of 35, orchiepididymitis is usually associated with urogenital infections (2C-161) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (162), mainly enterobacteria. It may sometimes be related to a pathology of the lower apparatus, such as urethral stricture, prostate adenoma (127), chronic prostatitis, or due to an instrumental or surgical maneuver.

- From puberty to the age of 35, orchiepididymitis is frequently sexually transmitted (STIs 162), involving Chlamydia trachomatis and gonococcus, and often associated with urethritis. Urethritis is manifested by a more or less purulent spontaneous meatus discharge outside the micturition period and burning during micturition.

- The clinical presentation of orchiepididymitis includes painful enlargement of a bursa associated with progressive or sudden onset fever of variable intensity depending on the associated pathogens (STI, BGN) and local signs of variable intensity: scrotal pain radiating along the cord of gradual and not sudden onset (as opposed to torsion of the spermatic cord), painful induration of the cord and all or part of the epididymis, and an inflamed scrotum.

- Classically, lifting the testicle relieves the pain (positive Prehn's sign), making it possible to distinguish torsion.

- It is important to look for favoring factors such as the insertion of a bladder catheter (BCC), the indwelling use of a BCC, recent performance of an endoscopy, existence of a prostatic adenoma (127), urethral stricture, or a notion of contagion (in favor of an STI).

- The presence of urinary signs (125) (burning, dysuria, pollakiuria) with high fever, sweating, and chills should prompt a search for an associated acute prostatitis (161). A rectal examination will reveal a prostate that is enlarged, tense, regular, and very painful.

- Orchi-epididymitis is a rare entity in children and should be investigated for associated uropathy at a distance from the acute episode, particularly in the event of a recurrence.",1.0,10.098571428571429,False,True,0.7952046990394592,0.6023387312889099,c,False,2,4

**Title:** Knowing How to Diagnose Superficial and Deep Urticaria

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

**Superficial Urticaria**

The primary lesion is an edematous papule, erythematous with a clear border and sometimes a lighter center. There is no particular topography. The shape and size of the papules may vary; there may be annular or polycyclic lesions, and the papules may range from a few millimeters to large, geographically-contoured plaques. The three major characteristics of these edematous papules in superficial urticaria are their ""pruriginous, fleeting, and migratory"" nature.

**Deep Urticaria or Angioedema**

The primary lesion is a firm, non-itchy, pinkish-white edema with a sensation of tension or pain. This edema is transient, receding within 72 hours without scarring, and most often occurs in areas rich in mast cells: the face, extremities, and external genitalia. In the case of anaphylaxis, the edema may be of laryngeal or pharyngeal origin, which may affect the prognosis.

- Superficial urticaria is isolated in 50% of cases.
- Superficial urticaria is associated with deep urticaria in 40% of cases.

**Definitions**

Four simple principles govern management, based on patient education:

- Patients must be informed of the importance of treating a gout attack at the earliest signs. They must be able to self-treat according to a predefined treatment explained and prescribed by their doctor.

- Patients should be aware that treating an attack alone is not enough to treat gout, and should understand the importance of hypouricemic treatment, which alone can permanently relieve the symptoms of gout.

- The choice of treatment for a gout attack depends on:
  - Co-morbidities (cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency defined by an estimated GFR <60 ml/min, diabetes, peptic ulcer, infections).
  - A history of drug intolerance.
  - Potential drug interactions.
  - The number and type of joints affected.

- The drugs that can be used to treat the crisis are:
  - Colchicine: 1 mg at the onset of the attack, followed by ¬Ω mg an hour later, i.e., 1.5 mg on day 1 and continued on subsequent days at 0.5 mg √ó 2-3 per day depending on progress.
  - NSAIDs per os: at the onset of the attack and for a short period during the attack. They should be avoided in cases of renal insufficiency or severe cardiovascular disease.
  - Oral corticosteroid therapy: from the onset of the attack, at a dose of 30 to 35 mg per day (prednisone equivalent) for 3 to 5 days.
  - Local corticosteroid therapy (intra-articular).
  - IL-1 inhibitors: in hospital, if other treatments have failed or are contraindicated.

Other pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures may be combined:

- Rest (simple brace, orthosis) and joint icing (with skin protection, which shortens the duration of access).
- Analgesic medication according to pain assessment.",1.0,11.863529411764706,False,True,0.7921873331069946,0.9741114179293314,c,False,4,4

**Renal Colic (265):**

- Unilateral lumbar pain of sudden onset with oblique distal and anterior radiation towards the homolateral iliac fossa, or even the external genitalia. Absence of analgesic position, sometimes accompanied by agitation. Functional urinary signs may also accompany the pain (urinary frequency, burning, haematuria), as well as digestive signs (nausea, vomiting). The pain is due to tension in the excretory cavities following the obstruction of the urinary tract.

== Clinical Examination ==

- **Interview:** History (lithiasis?), medication taken, time since onset of pain.
- **Physical Examination:** Pain on palpation and shaking of the lumbar fossa. No pain on palpation of the spine or paravertebral muscle masses. No tenderness. Urine dipstick: positive for blood in >70% of cases. Temperature taken.

== Additional Examinations ==

- **Biological:** CBC, platelets, ionogram, creatinine. Look for impairment of renal function. If associated infection is suspected: ECBU.
- **Imaging:** Ultrasound + PSA (sensitivity 80-90%) or ideally abdominal and pelvic CT scan without contrast injection (sensitivity 96%) within 24-48 hours in the absence of complications (fever, hyperalgesia, renal failure/oligo-anuria). Imaging looks for dilatation of the pyelo-caliceal cavities and an obstruction in the urinary tract (stone, tumour, etc.).
- **Emergency Imaging:** By uninjected AP CT scan, then possibly injected if there is any doubt about the diagnosis (no obstruction, no dilatation) in the event of fever, renal failure (uninjected), hyperalgesia (no injection).

**Acute Pyelonephritis (161):**

- Unilateral lumbar pain, insidious in onset, most often associated with hyperthermia and functional signs of the lower tract (pollakiuria, urethral burning, urgency). Pain on shaking the lumbar fossa during clinical examination. Urine dipstick positive for blood, leukocytes +/- nitrites most often. Biological tests: CBC, platelets, ionogram, creatininemia, ECBU.
- **Imaging:**
  - Simple PNAS: If fever or pain persists after 48-72 hours: ultrasound or ideally non-injected AP CT scan, then possibly injected if there is diagnostic doubt (absence of obstruction, dilatation) or complication (abscess).
  - ANP at risk of complication or serious: As a matter of urgency: non-injected AP CT scan, then possibly injected if there is any doubt about the diagnosis (absence of obstruction, dilatation).

**Torsion of the Spermatic Cord (50):**

- Pain of abrupt onset, atypical presentation with possible projected lumbar pain. No analgesic position. In young men. No associated fever or urinary signs. Physical examination usually reveals an ascending testicle, difficult to examine, retracted at the ring.

Understanding the principles of comprehensive management of carcinomas involves specific treatment protocols for different types of skin cancer.

For Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), treatment consists of surgical excision with safety margins of 4 to 10 mm, based on clinical and histological prognostic criteria. Poor prognostic factors include location on the periorificial surface, size greater than 2 cm, sclerodermiform, and recurrent forms.

For Squamous Cell Carcinoma (EC), treatment consists of surgical excision with safety margins of 5 to 10 mm, depending on prognostic markers.

**Detailed Description of the Different Stages of Care:**

- Preliminary biopsy if diagnosis is uncertain or before complex surgical treatment
- Consultation to announce the diagnosis
- RCP presentation if carcinoma has a poor prognosis or is locally advanced
- Surgery and anatomopathological examination of the specimen:
  - Immediate surgical resection if diagnosis is highly probable
  - Simple suture removal, usually on an outpatient basis
  - If surgical excision is incomplete or ""borderline"": revision is essential

**Understanding the Principles of Comprehensive Melanoma Management**  
Following histological confirmation of melanoma, revision surgery should be carried out to achieve a complete and wide excision of the lesion with safety margins in healthy skin. The choice of margins is dictated by the Breslow index. The following margins are recommended:

- For intraepidermal melanomas: 0.5 cm margins
- If the Breslow index is less than or equal to 1 mm: margins of 1 cm
- If the Breslow index is between 1.01 and 2 mm: margins of 1 to 2 cm
- If the Breslow index is greater than 2 mm: 2 cm margins

For non-invasive Dubreuilh's melanoma, a margin of 1 cm is recommended.

Descriptive surveys can lead to comparisons over time or space. This is only feasible if the populations are comparable in terms of characteristics like age or gender structure, which may influence the occurrence of health problems. This comparability is achieved through ""standardization.""

A standardized frequency measure is the weighted average of this frequency measure specific to classes of individuals, often categorized by age and sex. The weights are the proportions of individuals in each class within a reference population, such as the general French population. The frequency measure most commonly reported in a standardized way is the incidence rate.

A standardized incidence rate is the incidence rate that would have been estimated in the studied population if it had the same age and sex structure as the reference population.

**Rubric:** Management

- Treatment is aetiological (discontinuation of medication, treatment of diabetes mellitus), preventive (especially in patients who do not have free access to water), and symptomatic.
- In the case of acute symptomatic hypernatremia in adults, the initial rate of correction should be 2 mmol/L/h (without exceeding 10-12 mmol/L/d).
- When hypernatremia has been present for a long time, the rate of correction should not exceed 0.5 mmol/L/h, i.e., 10-12 mmol/L/24h, to avoid inducing cerebral oedema and convulsions.
- The amount of water to be administered can be estimated using the following formula: Water deficit = 60% √ó weight √ó ([Natremia/140] - 1).
- Water can be administered in the form of:
  - Drinking water orally or via a gastric tube
  - 5% glucose solution (50 g per L) or 2.5% glucose solution (25 g per L) intravenously
  - Hypo-osmotic sodium chloride solution (4.5 ‚Ä∞ NaCl)

- The most appropriate form will be chosen according to the patient's state of consciousness, whether or not there is nausea or vomiting, and the state of hydration of the extracellular compartment. Schematically:
  - In the event of overall dehydration, priority should be given to correcting blood volume by administering hypotonic saline at 4.5 g/L.

**Description:** Knowing the mechanisms of action.

**Rubric:** Management

The most common non-opioid analgesics used for several types of pain include:

- Tier I analgesics (paracetamol and nefopam)
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
- ""Adjuvant"" analgesics (initially used for indications other than pain): antidepressants and anti-epileptics

This section does not cover analgesics that are not or not widely available (cannabis), specific to one indication (e.g., acute pain, migraine, neuropathic pain) (items 135 and 136) or muscle relaxants (see ""benzodiazepines"" in item 330 and ""muscle relaxants"" in item 135).

== Paracetamol ==

The most widely administered tier I analgesic in the world, the reference antipyretic, taken orally, by injection, or rectally, alone or combined with caffeine (if combined with opiates, see tier II analgesics), from birth.

### Mechanisms

Central action still poorly understood (effect on serotonergic controls and probably on calcium channels); no anti-inflammatory effect.

### Indications

- Mild to moderate acute or chronic pain, except neuropathic pain (ineffective)
- Severe pain in combination with opiates

### Undesirable Effects

- Hepatotoxicity exceptional under normal conditions (< 4 g/day) (depletion of hepatic glutathione stocks)
- Risk factors: elderly patients, alcoholism, undernutrition, severe renal insufficiency, regular overdoses
- Renal toxicity and thrombocytopenia only if overdosed
- Exceptional allergic reactions

### Drug Interactions

- Increased effect of oral anticoagulants (warfarin)
- Increased hepatotoxicity when taking chronic alcohol or enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine)
- Increased risk of neutropenia if taking zidovudine
- Risk of reduced lamotrigine effect

### Monitoring

Reduce doses if severe hepatic or renal impairment. No contraindication during pregnancy.

### Main Causes of Failure

Wrong indication (e.g., neuropathic pain). If used to treat headache attacks, risk of chronic daily headaches due to drug abuse (consumption > 15 days/month).

== Nefopam ==

Non-opioid central analgesic, level I, without anti-inflammatory or antipyretic action. IM or IV route authorized; oral route possible in exceptional cases (off-label).

### Mechanism

Central action (inhibition of mono-amine re-uptake).

### Indications

Post-operative analgesia in combination with other opioid or non-opioid analgesics. Analgesic potency comparable to weak opioids (codeine, tramadol, opium).

### Undesirable Effects

- Probable anticholinergic effects: tachycardia, urinary retention, confusion, sweating
- Nausea and vomiting
- Drowsiness
- Convulsions (lowering of the epileptogenic threshold)
- Frequent, especially if administered rapidly

### Contraindications

- Children (< 15 years), pregnant women, epilepsy
- Patients at high risk of urinary retention or acute angle-closure glaucoma
- Elderly patients (aged 75 and over): relative contraindication, mainly due to the risk of confusion, to be discussed

### Monitoring

Reduce dose if elderly, particularly if rhythm disorders, prostatic adenoma, narrow-angle glaucoma. Avoid prolonged administration.

### Main Causes of Failure

Wrong indication (e.g., neuropathic pain).

== Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatories ==

Many molecules: ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, celecoxib... oral, IV, IM, suppositories, or topical.

### Mechanisms

Inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 cyclooxygenases: COX-1 synthesizes the prostaglandins (Pg) involved in gastro-duodenal protection + pro-aggregating effects; COX-2 synthesizes the Pg involved in inflammation + anti-aggregating effects. Both contribute to renal hemodynamics. Pure analgesic effects at low doses and anti-inflammatory effects at high doses. Celecoxib: preferential effects on COX-2 but gastrointestinal risks only reduced (by half).

### Indications

- Acute pain ++ in particular dental pain, osteoarticular pain including osteoarthritis flare-ups, lumbago, traumatic/postoperative pain, renal colic, dysmenorrhea, migraine attacks
- Chronic osteoarticular pain (chronic osteoarthritis, low back pain) if paracetamol fails, with prescription limited in duration and stopped if the disease goes into remission

### Adverse Reactions and Drug Interactions

- Digestive: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, complications (ulcers, perforations, hemorrhage, anorectitis) especially if age > 65 years, history of ulcer or helicobacter, severe general illness, and depending on dose, drug combinations (corticosteroids/anticoagulants/anti-aggregants), may require proton pump inhibitors (‚â• 1 risk factor)
- Renal effects: functional renal failure, fluid retention, hyperkalemia, nephropathy, especially if: risk of hypovolemia (cardiac insufficiency, decompensated cirrhosis, low-sodium diet) or nephropathy, elderly subject or in combination with: diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists
- Skin rash
- Respiratory allergy (Quincke, asthma)
- Hepatotoxicity
- Neurological effects (10%) (headache, dizziness, even confusion)
- Thrombotic risk with high long-term doses ++ coxibs and diclofenac
- Precautions for use with lithium (increased lithaemia)
- Contraindications: pregnancy, ulcers, digestive perforation, digestive hemorrhage, renal failure, severe infection (pro-infectious risk), combination with high-dose methotrexate (hematological toxicity)

### Monitoring Procedures

Clinical, in particular digestive and renal complications ++

### Main Causes of Failure

Wrong indication (e.g., neuropathic pain).

== Antidepressants for Pain Relief ==

Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (duloxetine, venlafaxine). Antidepressants, mood-independent analgesics, anxiolytics, sedatives, or psycho-stimulants.

### Mechanisms in Analgesia

Action on descending inhibitory controls by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline. Anticholinergic properties and sodium channel inhibition (tricyclics).

### Indications

- Neuropathic pain
- Treatment of migraine and tension headaches (amitriptyline)
- Chronic osteoarticular pain and fibromyalgia (off-label) (duloxetine)

### Undesirable Effects

- Clinical effects: removal of inhibition (suicidal risk) (initiation)
- Tricyclics: anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension, constipation, dysuria, cardiotoxicity, sexual disorders, glaucoma), somnolence, weight gain
- IRSNA: nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, constipation, sexual disorders, acute hypertension (rare) (venlafaxine ‚â• 150mg/d)
- Biological effects (rare): elevated liver enzymes, hyponatremia

### Drug Interactions/Counter-indications

- Absolute contraindications (tricyclics): prostate adenoma, recent ischemic heart disease, narrow-angle glaucoma
- Contraindications (all): combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), pregnancy, breast-feeding
- Precautions: combination with high-dose tramadol (risks: epilepsy, serotonin syndrome)
- Reduced efficacy of VKAs (duloxetine: CYP2D6 enzymatic inducer)

### Monitoring Procedures

- Driving (all)
- Tricyclics: ECG (initiation), blood pressure (supine, standing), dysuria ++ co-prescriptions, comorbidities, or high doses (‚â• 75 mg/d)
- If confused, look for hyponatremia
- Hepatic risks (elevated transaminases)

### Main Causes of Failure

- Clinical: low doses (no titration) or undesirable effects (rapid initiation)
- Genetic polymorphism (cytochrome P450 isoenzyme): contributes to individual variability in response and the occurrence of adverse effects

== Anti-epileptic Painkillers ==

Gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate.

Anti-epileptic, analgesic, mood-stabilizing (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine) and anxiolytic/sleep-repairing (gabapentin, pregabalin) properties.

### Mechanisms in Analgesia

- Gabapentin, pregabalin: subunit binding of voltage-dependent calcium channels: reduced release of excitatory neurotransmitters
- Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate: block voltage-dependent sodium channels, reduce glutamate release (topiramate)

### Indications

- Neuropathic pain (gabapentin, pregabalin)
- Essential trigeminal neuralgia (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine)
- Treatment of migraine (topiramate)
- Perioperative context (antihyperalgesic effects)

### Adverse Effects, Interactions, Contraindications, Monitoring Procedures

### Definition

Medical ethics is a field of philosophical research, public debate, and legal rules concerning the ethics of research, the development and use of techniques in the life sciences and health, and biomedical practices.

The emergence of bioethics in the second half of the 20th century was part of a wider movement to question science and technology, our increasing capacity for action, and the new dimensions of our responsibility.

V.R. Potter, a biologist and cancer specialist who coined the term bioethics in the early 1970s, saw it as ""a global ethic for the survival of human beings and the planet."" He advocated for an alliance between the biological sciences and ethics, science and the humanities, and social control of scientific knowledge and progress.

However, the creation in 1971 of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University in the United States restricted bioethics to the medical field. American sociologist R. Fox identified three stages in the development of bioethics:

- **1960s**: Bioethics became part of a growing awareness of problems such as medical experimentation, resuscitation, and organ transplants, with religious figures entering the field.
- **1970s**: Jurists and philosophers secularized the debate and contributed to the development of regulatory frameworks, emphasizing rational, argumentative debate and the recognition of fundamental principles.
- **1990s**: Economic issues and concerns became part of the debate, with justice becoming increasingly important in a context of constrained resources.

In recent decades, questions raised by medical progress (e.g., procreation, genetics, predictive medicine, neuroscience, artificial intelligence) have increasingly concerned the definition and future of humanity. For example, the slogan of the 2018 Bioethics Forum was ""What kind of world do we want for tomorrow?""

Contemporary developments in medicine have shifted the boundaries of therapeutic intervention both upstream of the disease (screening, prevention, procreation) and downstream (end of life, resuscitation, organ transplants). In most of these areas, the challenges are as much societal as they are medical. Medical intervention at the frontiers of life increases the scope of our collective responsibility and transforms medical practices into societal problems with high moral stakes, such as who should be born and die, and under what conditions. These questions must be discussed in a rational and pluralist way.

The globalization of Western biomedicine is also globalizing the ethical issues associated with its development. In 2005, UNESCO published a ""Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights,"" and in 2015, a book entitled ""Why Global Bioethics?"" The World Medical Association published a ""Handbook of Medical Ethics"" for physicians and medical students worldwide.

Bioethics should follow the development of biomedicine globally and establish itself as a model. However, it is Western values that are being disseminated internationally‚Äîcertain conceptions of illness, life, and death, or principles such as autonomy‚Äîin very different socio-cultural contexts. Is a global or universal bioethics possible without becoming the imposition of a dominant way of thinking?

Today, contrary to V.R. Potter's vision, bioethics is a subset of health ethics; it concerns the issues raised by the emergence of new biotechnologies and the questions raised by the application of these scientific advances to humans. The aim of bioethics is to explore the issues raised by the development and application of biomedical technologies and to analyze the transition between what is possible and what should be.",1.0,9.255714285714287,False,True,0.7140254974365234,0.626033365726471,c,False,3,3

**Epidemiology/Physiopathology/Natural Evolution**

- Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause, but infectious mononucleosis (IM) can also be associated with CMV, HIV, or toxoplasmosis (see mononucleosis syndrome).
- EBV belongs to the Herpesviridae family, subfamily gamma-herpesvirinae, genus lymphocryptovirus.
- Human-to-human transmission occurs via the respiratory route (saliva).
- The preferred age for primary infection is adolescence, but it can occur in younger children (acute or prolonged fever) or in adults.
- 80-90% of adults are immunized (in France and wealthy countries).
- There is a possibility of asymptomatic reactivation in immunocompetent patients and symptomatic reactivation in immunocompromised patients (transplants).

**Clinical Features**

- Incubation period is 4 to 6 weeks.
- Prolonged contagiousness after infection due to salivary excretion.
- The typical clinical picture includes a fever of variable intensity, which may be prolonged, significant asthenia, pseudomembranous angina, cervical polyadenopathy, but other territories may be affected, often with splenomegaly.
- The rash is inconstant, maculopapular, and favored by ampicillin use. Facial edema may be present.
- Other signs and symptoms may include hepatomegaly, hepatalgia, and more rarely jaundice.
- EBV infection can also present as a prolonged fever, particularly in young children.
- Symptoms vary in duration, and adolescents may experience marked asthenia.

**Biologically**

- Mononucleosis syndrome (Leukocyte abnormality SD-216), sometimes thrombocytopenia.
- Frequent hepatic cytolysis.
- Diagnosis is based on serology and the presence of anti-VCA IgM without anti-EBNA IgG.

**Complications/Seriousness**

- Obstructive ENT issues linked to tonsillar and adenoid hypertrophy, with rare but possible superinfection: sinuses, middle ear, cavum.
- Rarer complications include cardiac (myocarditis and pericarditis), hematological (hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia), and neurological (lymphocytic meningitis, meningoencephalitis).
- In immunocompromised patients: lymphoproliferative syndrome.
- In predisposed individuals (Purtilo syndrome): monocytomacrophagic activation syndrome.
- EBV is also a risk factor for Burkitt's lymphoma.

**Differential Diagnoses**

- Other infections:
  - Bacterial: Scarlet fever (erythematopulmonary angina), exceptional diphtheria (extensive pseudomembranous angina).
  - Viral: CMV (no angina), primary HIV infection (caution with adolescents).
  - Parasitic: Toxoplasmosis (cervical adenopathy, sometimes general signs).
- Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (particularly DRESS).
- Lymphoma (polyadenopathies).
- Kawasaki disease.",1.0,15.453333333333337,False,True,0.7175859212875366,0.6479348341623942,c,True,5,3

**Description:** When faced with unusual clinical signs and/or an incoherent set of symptoms, health professionals must become reflexively aware of the existence of a rare disease. The latest National Plan for Rare Diseases (PNMR3) sets the goal of diagnosing every patient with a rare disease within one year. Every doctor should be aware of the highly structured national organisation, consisting of rare disease centres of reference (CRMRs) and rare disease health networks (FSMRs), which act as relays for the diagnosis of these diseases and promote clear healthcare pathways.

In line with the vision of the IRDiRC consortium (International Consortium for Research into Rare Diseases), the National Plan for Rare Diseases 3 (PNMR3) aims to ensure that all patients suffering from rare diseases receive a precise diagnosis one year after their first specialist medical consultation and can benefit from the care and therapies available. Patients without a precise diagnosis one year after the first specialist consultation are limited to those for whom the current scientific, medical, and technical knowledge does not allow a precise diagnosis. These patients are then said to be at a diagnostic impasse. When faced with unusual clinical signs (e.g., symptoms at an earlier age than usual) and/or an incoherent set of symptoms, health professionals should reflexively suggest a rare disease.

The national organisation is highly structured and is based on the following elements:

- **Centres de R√©f√©rence Maladies Rares (CRMR):** A CRMR is a network comprising a coordinating site, one or more constituent sites, and, where appropriate, one or more centres of competence (CCMR) or resource and competence centres. They are responsible for coordination, expertise, referrals, research, and training/education.

- **Centre of Competence (CCMR):** Ensures the care and follow-up of people suffering from rare diseases as close as possible to their home, based on an adapted territorial network and in liaison with the CRMR on which it is functionally dependent.

- **Rare Disease Health Network (FSMR):** An organisation that coordinates a network of hospital care centres, diagnostic and research laboratories, social and medico-social structures, universities, associations, and any other partner or institution with complementary expertise in the field of rare diseases concerned.

**Resources:**

- 23 national rare disease health networks (FSMR) mirroring the 24 European Reference Networks (ERN), 20 of which concern rare diseases.

**Description:** Notion of prevalence, frequent under-estimation

**Epidemiology**

- A third of French people (31%) over the age of 18 report suffering from daily pain for more than 3 months, and 20% have chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity.
- One in two chronic pain patients has a reduced quality of life.
- Two out of three patients are not relieved by their treatment.
- More than 60% of patients admitted to emergency departments experience moderate to severe pain, and less than one in two receive analgesic treatment on admission.
- Almost 20% of patients who undergo surgery are left with painful after-effects.
- 45% of chronic pain patients take time off work for an average of more than 4 months a year.
- Chronic pain patients take five times more time off work compared to the general population.
- More than 70% of patients suffering from chronic pain experience psychosocial repercussions, including sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and cognitive problems.

**Pain in the City**

- Pain is the number one reason for consultations, both in emergency departments and with general practitioners.
- Less than 3% of chronic pain patients are treated in a specialized pain center or facility, which acts as a multi-professional referral center for the most complex patients in conjunction with outpatient care.

**Pain in Hospital**

- Induced pain: Caused by the caregiver during clinical examination to identify mechanisms involved, providing useful information for management.
- Iatrogenic pain: Unintentionally caused by the caregiver or treatment in foreseeable circumstances. This includes pain induced by care (such as re-dressing of dressings, sutures, vascular punctures, mobilization in intensive care) or by diagnostic examinations (such as biopsies), sometimes referred to as procedural pain. Procedural pain must be anticipated and prevented by appropriate means, often requiring a multimodal approach (systemic medication, local or loco-regional anesthesia, anxiety management, complementary techniques such as hypnosis, neurostimulation, etc.).",0.2,15.15571428571429,False,True,0.591433584690094,0.5221370657285055,c,False,3,4

**Definitions**

- Pain is currently defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as: ""a sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage.""

- This definition is accompanied by the following comments:

  - Pain is always a personal experience influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors.

  - Pain and nociception are two distinct phenomena. The presence of pain cannot be deduced solely from the activity of sensory neurons.

  - Over the course of their lives, individuals learn the concept of pain. (Refers to the notion of pain as a ""learned"" or conditioned concept)

  - Although pain can play an adaptive role, it can also have deleterious effects on social and psychological function and well-being.

  - The verbal description of pain is only one of the ways in which pain is expressed; the inability to communicate does not exclude the possibility that a human or an animal may feel pain.

- Chronic pain is generally defined as persistent or recurrent pain for at least 3 months and 2 months for chronic post-operative pain.",0.6,12.037500000000005,False,True,0.7850296497344971,0.6634305715560913,b,False,5,4

**Title:** Knowing How to Prevent Infectious Diarrhoea  
**Description:** Hand Hygiene and Complementary Hygiene Precautions  

**Primary Prevention**  
Primary prevention of infectious diarrhoea involves good hand hygiene before meals and after using the toilet, in all circumstances, given the frequency with which children put their hands to their mouths. Additionally, food must be well preserved, respecting the cold chain. In tropical areas, ensure to drink treated (boiled) or mineral water and eat food that is cooked and hot, or washed and peeled if raw.

In the event of hospitalisation, additional contact precautions are necessary to avoid cross-transmission. Reinforced precautions (type 2) are required in the event of C. difficile infection. C. difficile spores are resistant to hydroalcoholic solutions, so hand washing with soap must precede the application of SHA in this situation.

Eviction from the community is indicated in cases of shigellosis, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, Salmonella Typhi, and Paratyphi.

**Vaccinations**  
- There is a specific anti-rotavirus vaccination for children before the age of 6 months (live oral vaccines with a 2- or 3-dose schedule; risk of acute intestinal intussusception is higher if administered after the age of 6 months). This vaccine is widely recommended in European countries, with an impact on severe forms of the disease and hospitalisations, even in older children (under 5 years old). However, it is not recommended in France in 2021. It may be prescribed but will not be reimbursed.

- Anti-typhoid vaccines: In 2021, two types of vaccines are available in France:
  - A monovalent Typhim<sup>R</sup> typhoid fever vaccine, composed of Vi capsular polyosides from a strain of Salmonella typhi, can be used in adults and children over 2 years of age. It is contraindicated in the event of allergy to one of the constituents.
  - Typhoid fever-Hepatitis A vaccine: This vaccine is composed of capsular polyosides Vi from a strain of Salmonella typhi and inactivated hepatitis A virus. It is contraindicated in the event of allergy to one of the components. It may be used in patients aged 16 and over.

For these two vaccines, seroprotection against typhoid decreases rapidly during the first year (around 40% of those vaccinated are protected after one year, outside endemic areas). A booster is indicated between 24 and 36 months after the first injection for Typhim<sup>R</sup> and after 36 months for Tyavax<sup>R</sup>, if protection against typhoid fever is still required. As far as hepatitis A is concerned, a booster can be given as early as one year after the first injection of Tyavax<sup>R</sup>, either with a hepatitis A vaccine or with Tyavax<sup>R</sup> depending on the risk of contamination.

Under the age of 2, none of these vaccines induces an effective immune response. As far as hepatitis A is concerned, a booster can be given in the first year of life, either with a hepatitis A vaccine or with Tyavax<sup>R</sup>, depending on the risk of acquiring typhoid.",1.0,14.646666666666672,False,True,0.7470917701721191,0.6402694781621298,c,False,5,1

Venous approaches are a major source of iatrogenia (""Prescribing and monitoring a vascular approach (SD-271)""). This is why:

- Venous ports should be removed as soon as possible to limit iatrogenicity.
- Their indication and maintenance must be reviewed daily in light of the treatments and monitoring required.

**Complications during follow-up**

These complications may be locoregional or general. They can be mechanical, thrombotic, or infectious. Their frequency depends on:

- Location
- The clinical context
- The time required to install the equipment

**Infectious complications**

Infection of the equipment can lead to bacteremia (""Positive blood culture (SD-190)"") and secondary foci. Early infections are most often related to insertion and late infections to handling: importance of asepsis during insertion and use (""Preventing healthcare-associated infections (SD-311)"").

Infectious complications can take the form of:

- Inflammatory syndrome
- CRP elevation
- Suppuration at the puncture site
- Erythema along the venous pathway or adjacent to the infusion chamber
- Isolated fever disappearing after removal of the equipment (""Hyperthermia/fever (SD-044)"")
- Fever when using the equipment (""Hyperthermia/fever (SD-044)"")

The presence of a cough with chronic sputum supports the diagnosis of obstructive CKD, such as COPD or bronchial dilatation. Clinical examination should assess for wheezing, ronchi, decreased vesicular murmur (in cases of associated emphysema), and signs of thoracic distension, including barrel chest, Hoover's sign, increased antero-posterior diameter, shortening of the suprasternal segment, and tripod position.

Restrictive CKD should be suspected in the presence of exertional dyspnoea. Infiltrative lung disease may be indicated by a dry cough and tele-inspiratory crackles. Clinical examination may reveal skeletal deformity, such as kyphoscoliosis, and signs of diaphragmatic dysfunction, suggesting restrictive CKD related to an abnormality of the ventilatory pump (CKD with healthy lung).",1.0,16.62333333333334,False,True,0.8390798568725586,0.6466624538103739,c,False,2,1

**Title:** Definition of Maternal-Fetal Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection

**Rubric:** Definition

Maternal CMV infection is the first cause of congenital viral infection and the first non-hereditary cause of sensorineural hearing loss and mental retardation in early childhood.

Maternal-fetal transmission is possible in the periconceptional period (1 month before to 3 weeks after the start of pregnancy: 15% risk).

The overall transmission rate during pregnancy averages 40%. It increases with gestational age (36% in the 1st trimester, 40% in the 2nd, 65% in the 3rd).

Among infected children:
- 10% will develop a severe prenatal infection (intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, hydrocephaly, intracranial calcifications, fetal death in utero) ""Anomaly of psychomotor development (SD-115)""
- 10% are apparently healthy at birth but will have neurosensory sequelae (deafness in particular)
- 80% will have an asymptomatic form

Maternal reinfections also expose the child to these risks, although less frequently.

Severity is correlated with term: lower risk of transmission at the beginning of pregnancy but more severe forms.

In the event of maternal infection, the patient should be referred to a prenatal diagnosis center to discuss management (antiviral/amniocentesis/ultrasound/MRI).

The use of high-dose valaciclovir could reduce the risk of congenital infection for infections in the 1st trimester of pregnancy when introduced rapidly.

**Definitions**

**Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment**

This is a retinal detachment (RD) secondary to a retinal tear (from the Greek rhegma = tear), as opposed to exudative retinal detachments (as in hypertension or gestational toxaemia) and traction retinal detachments (in diabetic retinopathy in particular).

A tear in the peripheral retina may allow fluid to pass from the vitreous cavity into the subretinal space. This subretinal fluid (SRF) will lift the retina, leading to detachment.

A number of factors contribute to the occurrence of a retinal detachment:

- Age: Idiopathic retinal detachment, linked to posterior physiological vitreous detachment in the elderly.
- Myopia, particularly severe myopia (greater than -6 dioptres): The risk of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment increases with the degree of myopia.
- Cataract surgery (aphakic or pseudophakic retinal detachment), which is complicated by retinal detachment in around 2% of cases, with a variable delay, sometimes several years after the operation on the lens.
- Trauma
- Uveitis

The spontaneous course of the disease is very unfavorable: the retinal detachment inexorably spreads, encompassing the macula and then the entire retina. Within a few weeks, the detached retina suffers irreversible damage leading to blindness.

**Suggestive Clinical Signs**

- Myodesopsias followed by phosphenes corresponding to the onset of the retinal tear.
- Amputation of the peripheral visual field, corresponding to the formation of the retinal detachment.
- When the detachment lifts the macula, it causes a drop in visual acuity (white, painless eye).

A fundus examination, including examination of the peripheral retina, is used to:

- Make the diagnosis: The retina appears raised, mobile, forming voluminous folds.
- Search for the causal tear: The surgeon must try to find several tears, as multiple tears are common and failure to identify one or more tears can lead to failure of the surgical treatment.

**Treatment**

The treatment is solely surgical: its principle is to seal the peripheral retinal tear, stopping the passage of subretinal fluid; the residual fluid is then resorbed by the pigment epithelium and choroid, allowing the retina to reattach. The anatomical (around 90% success rate) and functional prognosis of surgical treatment is better the earlier it is performed, especially when the macula is raised by the detachment. Retinal detachment is therefore considered a ""semi-emergency,"" warranting surgery within a few days of diagnosis.",0.8,12.172307692307694,False,True,0.8272622227668762,0.49157679080963135,b,False,4,4

**1. Migraine Without Aura (MSA)**

- Diagnosed in patients who only have migraine attacks without aura and never have an aura.
- Seizures of headache with hypersensitivity to light and/or nausea.
- In children, the seizure is accompanied by paleness, often lasts less than 4 hours, and calms down with sleep.

**Diagnostic Criteria for Migraine Without Aura (ICHD-3 Code 1.1):**

- **A.** At least 5 attacks meeting criteria B-D
- **B.** Headache attacks lasting 4-72 hours (if untreated or ineffectively treated)
- **C.** Headache with at least two of the following characteristics:
  1. Unilateral topography
  2. Pulsatile type
  3. Moderate or severe intensity
  4. Aggravated by or leading to avoidance of routine physical activities (walking, climbing stairs)
- **D.** During the headache, at least one of the following:
  1. Nausea and/or vomiting
  2. Photophobia and phonophobia
- **E.** Is not better explained by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

**2. Migraine With Aura**

- Headache is preceded by transient neurological symptoms: progressive (> 5 minutes) and successive visual, sensory, or language disorders.
- Visual disorders: most frequent and affecting both eyes, positive phenomena associated with a blind spot (scintillating scotoma, phosphenes, zigzags) and sometimes deficits (blurred vision, homonymous lateral hemianopia).
- Sensory disorders, less frequent: unilateral paresthesias with or without hypoesthesia starting at the fingertips and rising over the minutes in a characteristic ""migraine-like march"" towards the elbow and then the hemiface.
- Language disorders are rarer: lack of words, dysarthria, sometimes total aphasia.
- The migraine aura is followed or accompanied by a headache that may have the same characteristics as the MSA headache, or be less intense and shorter. Sometimes the aura occurs without a headache. In this case, it is called an isolated aura without headache.
- Rare auras: ""basilar"" signs (vertigo, diplopia, ataxia, somnolence) and hemiplegic migraine (motor deficit) require treatment by a neurologist; retinal migraine (strictly monocular visual disorder) requires a full ophthalmological examination and a neurological opinion.

**Diagnostic Criteria for Migraine With Typical Aura (ICHD-3 Code 1.2.1):**

- **A.** At least two attacks meeting criteria B and C
- **B.** Aura including visual, sensory, and/or speech or language disturbances, all fully reversible, but no motor, basilar, or retinal symptoms.
- **C.** At least three of the following characteristics:
  1. At least one aura symptom develops progressively over ‚â• 5 minutes
  2. Two or more aura symptoms occur in succession
  3. Each aura symptom lasts 5-60 minutes
  4. At least one aura symptom is unilateral
  5. At least one symptom is positive
  6. The aura is accompanied or followed within 60 minutes by a headache
- **D.** Not better explained by another ICHD-3 diagnosis and transient ischemic attack has been excluded.

**3. Chronic Migraine**

Chronic migraine is defined as the occurrence of 15 or more days of headache per month for more than 3 months, corresponding to a migraine without aura or with aura on at least 8 days per month.

**4. Tension Headache**

Tension headaches are dysfunctional pain with an interaction of peripheral myogenic factors (tightening of the pericranial muscles) and central neurological factors with dysfunction of the pain control systems.

- **Description:** Attacks with blurred boundaries, of variable duration, bilateral headaches, anterior (bar) or posterior (with neck pain), of variable types (squeezing, clenching, pressure, burning, tingling), of an intensity that allows activities to continue and with no disabling associated signs. Pain can be improved by physical activity.
- **Psychological Aspects:** These headaches often occur in a particular context (anxiety, depression, difficult life events, and/or physical stress, shift work, sedentary lifestyle). Typically, tension headaches improve when the subject is relaxed, busy, or on the move.
- **Clinical Examination:** Sometimes tensing and sensitivity to pressure of the facial or cervical muscles.
- **Frequency of Seizures:**
  - Episodic tension headache (< 15 days/month)
  - Chronic tension headache which is part of CCQ; headache at least 15 days/month for > 3 months, without or with drug abuse.

- Homogeneous, sloping, non-systematic, non-retractile opacity, limited by a concave line above and medially (Damoiseau's line) obliterating the diaphragmatic dome and the edge of the heart. The Higham score is used to assess menorrhagia severity.
- The obliteration of a costodiaphragmatic cul-de-sac indicates a small effusion, which is best detected on a lateral view.
- A partitioned effusion is not always sloping, and its internal border may be convex.
- Signs of pleurisy under tension: complete opacity of the hemithorax, mediastinal displacement towards the opposite side.

**Chest X-ray, Supine, Front View:**

- More difficult to interpret because the pleural fluid moves posteriorly, so the interface between the lung and pleura is no longer tangential but becomes perpendicular to the X-rays.
- Asymmetry in lung transparency with opacity more marked on the side of the pleural effusion, with no clear boundary.

**Pleural Ultrasound:**

- Hypoechoic, sloping line separating the lung wall.
- Anechoic fluid may be an exudate or transudate.
- An echogenic or partitioned fluid is an exudate.

- Crescent-shaped image, concave towards the lung and therefore posterior.
- Haemothorax: on a CT scan without injection, the density of the blood (around 60 HU) is greater than that of the pleural fluid (0-20 HU).

**Title:** Knowing the definition and risk factors of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)  
**Description:** Know the definition, risk factors  
**Rubric:** Diagnosis  

**Definition:**

- Low weight for gestational age or LBW is defined as a weight (estimated in utero weight or birth weight) below the 10th percentile, in isolation. Severe LBW corresponds to a LBW below the 3rd percentile.

- IUGR most often corresponds to PAG associated with arguments in favor of a pathological growth defect: longitudinal growth arrest or inflection (at least 2 measurements 3 weeks apart).

**Risk Factors:**

1. **Foetal Pathologies**

   In 10-20% of cases, IUGR has a foetal cause: chromosomal anomaly, malformative syndrome, foetal infection (especially CMV). IUGR tends to be early (onset in the 2nd trimester) and severe (BP < 3rd percentile), and is often associated with morphological abnormalities.

2. **Vascular Pathologies**

   They account for 35-50% of IUGR. IUGR most often occurs late (in the 3rd trimester), but can occur early in severe forms. IUGR can recur in subsequent pregnancies.

   In the case of IUGR, the arguments in favor of a vascular cause are:

   - Association with hypertension or even pre-eclampsia (""Hypertension during pregnancy"" and ""Proteinuria""). This association is frequent and very suggestive, but inconstant.
   - Association with a chronic maternal pathology: chronic ""Arterial hypertension"", nephropathy (""Increased creatinine""), lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, diabetes with vascular complications (""Prevention of cardiovascular disease"").
   - A history of vascular IUGR in a previous pregnancy.
   - Association with oligohydramnios (reduced amniotic fluid).
   - Abnormal uterine or umbilical Doppler, reflecting disturbances in maternal-foetal exchanges. These Doppler anomalies result in a quantifiable increase in circulatory resistance in the uterine and/or umbilical arteries (resistance index, pulsatility index) and spectral disturbances.

3. **Other Causes and Risk Factors**

   These are the following factors:

   - Maternal age < 20 or > 35.
   - ""Malnutrition/Denutrition"", low weight gain during pregnancy.
   - Low socio-economic level (""Precarious social situation and isolation"").
   - Smoking (""Prevention of tobacco-related risks""), alcoholism, drug addiction.
   - Uterine malformations, multiple or large fibroids (""Discovery of a pelvic anomaly on medical imaging examination"").
   - Placental abnormalities, such as a chorioangioma.
   - Velamentous insertion of the cord which must be systematically sought.

**Title:** Know how to diagnose undescended testis

**Definitions**

Cryptorchidism is the consequence of a halt in the embryological migration of the testicle along the normal path between the lumbar region (where it is formed) and the scrotum (where it should be at birth).

- The incidence is higher in premature newborns.
- The anomaly is most often unilateral. It is bilateral in 10 to 20% of cases.
- On clinical examination, it is impossible to palpate the testicle in the bursa. The hernial orifices are closed.

**Topographical Diagnoses**

1. An undescended testicle which can be palpated on the normal migration path: the gonad is in the inguinal canal or at the upper root of the bursa.
2. An undescended testicle that can be palpated outside its normal migratory route: formerly known as ""true ectopia"", the testicle may be in a femoral, pubopenic, or crossed intrascrotal position.
3. An undescended testicle that cannot be palpated.

If, on clinical examination, the testicle is easily lowered by hand to the bottom of the bursa without tension, this is an oscillating testicle (""lift"") and not cryptorchidism.",1.0,14.270000000000007,False,True,0.7652244567871094,0.8737502892812093,c,False,3,3

**Description:** Initial and confirmatory consultations, carrying out, monitoring; Algorithm for the pathway for patients requesting abortion

**Initial Consultation:**  
The first consultation is with a doctor (gynecologist or GP) or midwife. The request to terminate the pregnancy is made. During this initial consultation, oral and written information is provided on the two methods, including their advantages and disadvantages. The patient is given a guide file and a certificate of medical consultation. The date of the start of pregnancy must be verified or an ultrasound scan must be prescribed. An appointment for the second consultation is also proposed. A psycho-social interview is compulsory for all patients and is mandatory for minors.

**Second Consultation:**  
During the second consultation, the patient confirms her request for an abortion in writing. The date of the onset of pregnancy is confirmed. The technique is then decided and explained to the patient. Follow-up care is scheduled according to the technique, including the appointment required and the place of procedure. Information on contraception, which may be prescribed prior to the abortion, is provided. The patient is given a new certificate confirming that the second consultation has taken place. Prescribing contraception and emergency contraception is discussed. ""Prescribe contraception and emergency contraception (SD-257)"" and ""Explain a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) (SD-352)"".

Please note that there is no time limit between the first two consultations.

**Carrying Out the Abortion:**  
The third stage consists of carrying out the abortion.

**Follow-Up Consultation:**  
A follow-up consultation must be carried out between 14 and 21 days after the abortion, regardless of the technique used. This is to ensure that there are no complications. The care provider must also ensure that the patient has taken the contraception appropriate to her situation. A psycho-social interview may also be proposed. This is only compulsory in the case of a ""medicinal"" abortion.

**Description:** Epidemiology (B), Prevention (A), Clinical Features (A), Particular Risk During Pregnancy (A), Fetopathy (B)  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

**Epidemiology:**  
- The rubella virus is an RNA virus, belonging to the Togaviridae family and the Rubivirus genus.  
- Human-to-human transmission occurs via the respiratory or transplacental route.  
- It is most often a benign infection (50% asymptomatic) but can be potentially severe during pregnancy (before 18 weeks of gestation) due to the risk of fetopathy.  

**Prevention:**  
- Vaccine prevention through MMR vaccination is compulsory for children under 2 years (two doses: 12 months then 16-18 months), with catch-up if not immune or if vaccination is incomplete, particularly for women of childbearing age outside pregnancy.  
- Mandatory declaration of cases.  
- No eviction from the community is required.  
- Avoid contact with non-immune pregnant women.  

**Clinical Features:**  
- Incubation period is 15-20 days.  
- Contagiousness lasts from 7 days before to 14 days after the rash.  
- There are 2 phases:  
  - Pre-eruptive (invasion): fever and nonspecific general signs.  
  - Eruptive: maculopapular exanthema with patches of healthy skin, paler than the measles rash, following the same kinetics (head to toe), fleeting, disappearing in 3 days. It is accompanied by moderate fever and inconstant lymphadenopathy, particularly in the retroauricular and posterior cervical regions.  

Complications are rare and include thrombocytopenia, joint damage (rare in children), and, more rarely, neurological damage. Treatment is symptomatic.  

**Risk During Pregnancy/Fetopathy/Congenital Rubella:**  
Transplacental passage of the virus during the first months of pregnancy (before 18 weeks' gestation) poses a risk of death in utero or congenital malformations, with risk being highest the earlier the pregnancy (70% to 100% risk if primary infection occurs before 11 weeks' gestation, up to 80% between 12 and 18 weeks' gestation).  

Viremia during embryogenesis can cause damage to the central nervous system, inner ear, eye, and cardiovascular system. Congenital rubella can result in growth retardation, sensory damage (deafness, eye damage), neurological damage (developmental delay, microcephaly), or even cardiac malformations.

Urticaria is a frequent inflammatory dermatosis affecting 15-20% of the population in its acute form. It occurs due to the activation of mastocytes through complex immunological or non-immunological mechanisms and is diagnosed clinically. The disease typically presents acutely, but it can become chronic, with flare-ups occurring daily or almost daily for more than 6 weeks at a time. Acute urticaria is usually non-allergic, although it may be allergic in rare cases.",1.0,9.054285714285715,False,True,0.7147294282913208,0.8134454488754272,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Distinguishing Functional Constipation from Organic and Congenital Causes  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

A distinction must be made between idiopathic or primary constipation and secondary constipation.

**A) Idiopathic Constipation:** This can be linked to two mechanisms: a slowdown in colonic transit (transit constipation) and/or a problem with rectal evacuation (distal constipation or dyschesia).

- **Transit Constipation:** Most often involves a reduction in the frequency and amplitude of colonic contractions. Patients typically describe a reduction in the number of weekly bowel movements, with dehydrated stools (small and hard because they remain in the colon longer).

- **Distal Constipation (Dyschesia):** May be due to:
  - A functional disorder (lack of anal sphincter relaxation or paradoxical contraction of the external anal sphincter during thrusting, disturbance of rectal sensitivity).
  - An anatomical disorder with a disturbance of pelvic statics (rectocele, descending perineum, internal rectal procidence, etc.).

In distal constipation, patients often describe exaggerated pushing efforts, a feeling of incomplete evacuation, and sometimes the need for digital maneuvers to encourage evacuation (most often in anatomical disorders).

**Note:** The two mechanisms of constipation can coexist.

**B) Secondary Constipation:** Indicative of an organic disease, digestive or extra-digestive, which should be investigated during the interview.

Any recent or recently aggravated constipation should be investigated for an organic cause, primarily colonic stenosis. A medicinal or toxic cause should be systematically sought in patients complaining of recent constipation.

**Warning Signs:**

- Changes in general condition, weight loss
- Nocturnal and insomniac pain
- Rectal bleeding, melena
- Severe, persistent constipation that does not respond to treatment or worsens without any obvious cause
- Rectal syndrome (epithelial discharge, tenesmus, false urination)
- Abdominal or rectal mass
- Biological indicators: anemia, inflammatory syndrome

**Possible Causes of Secondary Constipation:**

- **Digestive Causes:**
  - Luminal obstruction (colorectal or small bowel cancer)
  - Non-tumor stenosis (diverticular, inflammatory, ischemic)
  - Anal stenosis (anal canal cancer, inflammatory stenosis, scarring)
  - Extrinsic compression: benign or malignant tumor (e.g., ovary), peritoneal carcinomatosis, post-surgical adhesions, endometriosis, prolapse, etc.

- **Neurological Causes:**
  - Parkinson's disease
  - Multiple sclerosis
  - Spinal cord injury
  - Ponytail syndrome
  - Cerebrovascular accident

Iatrogenic parkinsonian syndrome, which may be characterized by tremor, is most often due to neuroleptics (antipsychotics) or hidden neuroleptics. This justifies systematic research into the use of these drugs when there is suspicion of an adverse drug reaction (SD-348).

The exaggeration of a physiological tremor may result from several drugs, including amiodarone, amytriptyline, antidepressants, salbutamol, theophylline, tacrolimus, interferon, and ciclosporin.

There is always a suspicion of an adverse reaction to medication (SD-348) in cases of chorea. Drugs such as L-dopa and dopaminergic agonists (responsible for peak dose dyskinesias, also known as mid-dose dyskinesias), antipsychotics, antiepileptics, lithium, calcium channel blockers, cocaine, amphetamines, or toxic drugs like carbon monoxide can be involved.

In the presence of dystonia, a systematic search should be made for the use of antipsychotics, sometimes hidden.

Medication can cause myoclonus, including antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, L-dopa, and valproate.",0.8571428571428571,16.220000000000006,False,True,0.8155422806739807,0.655910591284434,c,False,2,4

**1. General Principles of Migraine Treatment**

- **Factors Triggering Attacks:** Encourage a regular lifestyle with sufficient sleep, regular waking hours, balanced meals, optimal hydration, and physical activity. Discourage avoidance behaviors like extreme diets, which can reduce quality of life.

- **Types of Treatment:**

  - **Crisis Treatment:** Administer during each crisis to relieve headache within 2 hours, without recurrence within 24 hours. No treatment shortens auras. Prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics.

    - *Mild Onset Seizure:* Paracetamol.
    - *Mild Attacks (if paracetamol fails) and Moderate to Severe Attacks:* An NSAID and a triptan on the same prescription, not exceeding 2 days a week or 8 days a month.
    - Assess effectiveness after 3 attacks.

  - **Background Treatment:** Reduce frequency and severity of seizures in eligible patients. Aim to reduce headache days by 50% for episodic migraine and 30% for chronic migraine.

    - Non-specific treatments include beta-blockers, tricyclics, and anti-epileptic migraine drugs.
    - Slow onset of treatment; assess efficacy after 3 months.
    - If effective, continue for 6 to 12 months, then gradually reduce.
    - Specific treatments for severe migraines (8+ attack days/month) after failure of at least 2 oral treatments: antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway (not reimbursed).

- **Chronic Migraine with Drug Abuse:**

  - Prescribe background medication.
  - Advise outpatient weaning off over-used medication.
  - Prescribe another seizure treatment to manage rebound headache and residual seizures, aiming for 8 treatment days per month.

- **For Migraines Affecting Quality of Life:** Non-medicinal treatments such as physical exercise, physiotherapy, and psychological treatment (cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation) are proposed as complements to medicinal treatment.

**2. General Principles of the Treatment of Tension-Type Headache**

- **Information:** Explain that psychological tension can lead to headaches through excessive muscular tension.

- **Crisis Treatment:** Use paracetamol, aspirin, or NSAID, not exceeding 2 days per week or 8 days per month. Avoid opiates.

- **Background Treatment:** For frequent or chronic tension-type headaches, primarily use amitriptyline, increasing gradually to the maximum tolerated dose (10 to 50 mg). Other options include venlafaxine, gabapentin, and duloxetine.

- **Withdrawal:** In case of analgesic or NSAID abuse.

- **Non-Medicinal Treatment:** Encourage a healthy lifestyle, reduce sedentary behavior, and consider physiotherapy, relaxation, and cognitive-behavioral therapies for stress management.

**3. General Principles of the Treatment of Vascular Facial Pain**

- **Reassurance and Explanation:** Although benign, significant disability is possible. ENT, dental, and ophthalmological exams are unnecessary for typical attacks.

- **Assess Socio-Professional and Psychological Impact.**

- **General Measures:** Avoid alcohol, maintain regular sleep schedules, avoid naps, and encourage smoking cessation (though it does not lead to recovery).

- **Types of Treatment:**

  - **Crisis Treatments:** Taken during each crisis to relieve headache but do not prevent new attacks.

    - Subcutaneous sumatriptan injection relieves pain in 3 to 15 minutes, with a maximum of 2 injections per day. Sumatriptan spray may also be effective.
    - Oxygen therapy (12 to 15 L/min for 15 to 20 minutes) using a high-flow face mask is effective and reimbursed, prescribed by a neurologist, ENT specialist, or algology center.

  - **Background Treatments:** Useful for some patients to reduce attack frequency and severity.

    - Verapamil is first-line (120 mg, twice a day) after an ECG to check for contraindications. Higher doses may be used.
    - Other options include corticosteroid therapy for very frequent attacks, lithium carbonate for chronic forms, and surgical treatments for drug-resistant chronic forms.

**4. General Principles of the Treatment of Trigeminal Neuralgia**

- **Drug Treatment:**

  - Carbamazepine (400 to 1,600 mg/d), gradually increased, taken 2 or 3 times a day, 1/2 hour before meals. Side effects are common in elderly patients (drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia).
  - If intolerant, use oxcarbamazepine. Baclofen may be used alone or with carbamazepine. Other drugs include lamotrigine and gabapentin.
  - Treatment is the same for classic, secondary (e.g., to MS), or idiopathic neuralgia.

- **Surgical Treatments:** Offered when drug therapy fails.

  - Destruction of the trigeminal tract via gamma-knife radiosurgery, thermocoagulation, or balloon compression of Gasser's ganglion.
  - Surgery to decompress vascular-nervous impingement requires demonstration via strict MRI criteria.

**Title:** Donation of Organs Between Living People

**Description:** Familiarize yourself with the legal provisions governing living organ donation.

**Definitions**

For organ donation between living donors, the specific principles are as follows:

- Respect the consent procedure set out below.
- Harvesting is authorized only if there is a therapeutic interest for the recipient.
- No organs may be removed from protected adults (guardianship, trusteeship) or living minors, except for bone marrow and hematopoietic cells from bone marrow.

**Eligibility for Living Donors**

Historically, a living donor had to be the father or mother of the recipient, if possible. However, since 2004, donors may include:

- Spouses
- Brothers and sisters
- Sons and daughters
- Grandparents
- Uncles and aunts
- First cousins
- The spouse of the father or mother (blended couples)

The donor may also be anyone who can prove that they have lived with the recipient for at least two years. Compatibility between donors and recipients must be reliable. This reflects changes in society and medical and social demand.

**Cross-Donation**

The law provides for the possibility of cross-donation. Cross organ donation involving living donors can occur in a ""chain"" between individuals. For example, a patient A can bring a donor B (who is not compatible with A); but this donor B will be used by a patient C who will bring a donor D who will be compatible with patient A. This favors a donation chain between living donors and recipients.

There is a requirement for considerable coordination and simultaneity between the removal and transplant operations, which means that four operating theatres have to be mobilized at the same time for four people, for example. The law now allows the chain to be extended beyond two 'pairs'.

**Consent Procedure**

Consent from living donors must be explicit, free, and informed. It is based on a highly codified procedure:

- Complete information on risks from the doctor, including rare and exceptional risks.
- Reflection period.
- Opinion of an independent committee of experts, with the subject being informed by this committee and the freedom to consent assessed.
- Consent formulated and subsequently recorded before a magistrate (President of the Judicial Court) with the intervention of the guardianship judge for protected adults (for whom only marrow donation is authorized).

It should be noted that donation is prohibited for living donors who are minors or under guardianship or curatorship, except for marrow. In such cases, the consent of the parents (holders of parental authority) or legal representative is required, as described above.",1.0,13.718888888888891,False,True,0.7530782222747803,0.7991780042648315,d,False,4,4

**Definitions**

- The diagnostic approach first eliminates what is not a micturition disorder (125) and then looks for secondary micturition disorders before making the diagnosis of primary micturition disorders.
- In the majority of cases, voiding problems exist in the absence of an anatomical or neurological cause and are referred to as primary voiding problems. Sometimes bladder dysfunction is secondary to urinary tract infection (161), constipation, inadequate hydration, irritation of the external genital organs (50), etc. The association between constipation and micturition problems is frequent.
- Isolated primary enuresis (involuntary and unconscious urination) is a disorder that occurs exclusively during sleep without any daytime problems.

**Additional Information**

- However, some bladder weaknesses are not mictional disorders:
  - Permanent, drip incontinence due to ectopic abruption of the urinary tract.
  - Loss of urine after normal micturition, suggesting vaginal micturition in girls, encouraged by ""tight thighs"" or coalescence of the labia minora. In boys, it may be sub-preputial micturition (ballooning of the prepuce secondary to tight phimosis (50)).

- **In connection with adverse reactions:**
  - Abdominal pain
  - Release of blood through the mouth
  - Arterial hypertension
  - Localised or diffuse oedema
  - Acute haemorrhage
  - Abnormal erythrocyte indices (haemoglobin level, haematocrit)
  - Fall in haemoglobin

- **In connection with precautions for use:**
  - Adapting treatments for specific conditions (renal failure, liver failure, pregnancy, the elderly, etc.)
  - Follow-up consultation and therapeutic education for a patient with a history of cardiovascular disease
  - Follow-up consultation and therapeutic education for patients with heart failure
  - Monitoring patients with chronic renal failure
  - Geriatric follow-up consultations
  - Suspicion of an adverse reaction to medication or treatment

### Mechanism of Action
- Analgesic (low dose), antipyretic (low dose), and anti-inflammatory (higher dose) properties
- Reducing prostanoid production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) with two isoenzymes:
  - Cox-1, constitutive in almost all tissues, catalyses the formation of prostaglandins involved in the cytoprotection of the gastric mucosa and the preservation of renal function, as well as the production of thromboxane A‚ÇÇ (TxA‚ÇÇ, vasoconstrictive and proaggregant) by platelets.
  - Cox-2, essentially an isoenzyme that is inducible in inflammatory states, leads to the release of prostaglandins with a pathological role (fever, pain, inflammation, cell proliferation), but also a beneficial role in various processes (wound healing, renal function, ovulation, etc.) and governing the synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI‚ÇÇ), a vasodilator and antiaggregant, by endothelial cells.
- Non-selective NSAIDs inhibit Cox-1 and Cox-2 more or less selectively. Cox-2 selective NSAIDs or coxibs exert a preferential inhibition of Cox-2.
- NSAIDs marketed as low-dose, over-the-counter analgesics and antipyretics
- Hence the undesirable effects of NSAIDs, centred on digestive, renal, and cardiac complications.

### Indications
- Fever: low dose
- Pain:
  - Acute pain: dental pain, postoperative pain, post-traumatic pain, headaches or migraines, renal colic, ENT pathology, etc.
  - Chronic pain: degenerative rheumatological conditions (joint pain, spinal pain), neoplastic pain.
- Inflammation: higher dosage
  - Acute microcrystalline attacks (gout, chondrocalcinosis), abarticular pathologies, spinal pain, and radicular pain and chronic inflammatory rheumatism.
- Non-listed NSAIDs: low-dose NSAIDs, over-the-counter, symptomatic treatment of painful or febrile conditions.

### Contraindications
- Known allergy to the drug or related molecules.
- Active peptic ulcer and history of peptic ulcer or recurrent haemorrhage (at least two documented episodes).
- Asthma to aspirin and cross-allergy to other NSAIDs (Fernand-Vidal syndrome).
- Renal insufficiency, severe hepatocellular insufficiency, severe cardiac insufficiency.
- Pregnancy (from the 6th month for NSAIDs and throughout pregnancy for coxibs) and breast-feeding.
- Haemorrhagic diseases.
- Coxibs and diclofenac are contraindicated in patients with established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, or a history of stroke (including transient ischaemic attack). Etoricoxib is also contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

### Undesirable Effects
Virtually all NSAIDs are associated with the same complications. But the incidence depends on the nature of the NSAID, its dosage, the patient's condition, and any associated medications.

#### 1. Digestive Side Effects
- Frequent upper digestive symptoms (dyspepsia, gastralgia, nausea)
- Gastroduodenal ulcers and ulcer complications: digestive haemorrhage, perforation, less frequent with coxibs.
- Intestinal manifestations: ulcerations of the small intestine and colon, often unrecognised, sometimes with complications (perforation, haemorrhage, anaemia).

**Risk factors for serious digestive complications on NSAIDs:**
- Elderly subject: age > 65.
- A history of peptic ulcer disease, upper GI haemorrhage, or Helicobacter pylori infection.
- Severe co-morbidities.
- NSAIDs used in high doses or a combination of two NSAIDs.
- Co-prescription of aspirin (even in low doses for platelet anti-aggregation), anticoagulants, platelet anti-aggregants, corticosteroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
- Inflammatory disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis).
- Active inflammatory bowel disease and history of diverticulitis.

#### 2. Renal Complications
- Acute functional renal failure: especially in elderly patients or those suffering from hypovolaemia.

**Risk factors:**
- Treatment with diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II antagonists.
- Dehydration.
- Dehydrated diet.
- Heart failure.
- High blood pressure due to fluid retention.
- Chronic renal failure (chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy).

#### 3. Cardiovascular Complications
- Arterial thrombotic risk: arterial thrombosis, with a greater risk for coxibs and diclofenac and, to a lesser extent, ibuprofen. Risk exists even with short-term prescriptions.
- Heart failure: especially if there is a history of heart disease and in elderly patients on diuretics.
- Risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

#### 4. Allergic Complications
- Skin allergies (urticarial eruptions, severe bullous dermatitis)
- Bronchospasm

#### 5. Gynaecological and Obstetric Complications
- Tocolytic activity
- Foetus: premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and renal failure from the sixth month of pregnancy.
- Reduced fertility

#### 6. Other Undesirable Effects
- Neurosensory disorders (headaches, vertigo, tinnitus, etc.).
- Cytopenias
- Hepatitis

### Precautions for Use
1. Personalised assessment of the benefit/risk ratio (taking into account the indication, the patient's condition, co-morbidities, and current medication).
2. Lowest possible dosage (dose-dependent adverse effects) and principles of multimodal analgesia for dose reduction.
3. Prescription as short as possible.
4. Consider alternatives (paracetamol, corticosteroids), especially in elderly patients or those at risk.
5. In adolescents, NSAIDs intended for adults can be used from the age of 15.
   - In children > 3 to 4 years: ibuprofen and tiaprofenic acid, dose adapted to weight.
   - In infants: aspirin, dose to be adapted to weight, avoid if viral infection (flu, chickenpox).
6. If digestive risk factor: co-prescription of a half-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
7. If cardiovascular history or cardiovascular risk factors:
   - If you have a history of ischaemic heart disease, arterial disease of the lower limbs, a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or congestive heart failure:
     - Contraindication to coxibs and diclofenac.
     - Non-selective NSAIDs not recommended.
   - If cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, smoking): NSAIDs prescribed cautiously, only if necessary, with monitoring.
   - For patients on antiplatelet therapy:
     - The prescription of an NSAID should be avoided.
     - If necessary, should not lead to discontinuation of the antiaggregant.
8. The prescription of NSAIDs should be avoided in cases of renal insufficiency, including with topical cutaneous forms.
9. Avoid NSAIDs in the acute phase of a viral or bacterial infection.
10. Informing patients of the main risks involved and the risks of self-medication (NSAIDs sold over the counter as analgesics and antipyretics).
11. Search for possible drug interactions.

**Therapeutic Class Interactions:**
- **NSAIDs:** Do not combine two NSAIDs, including aspirin in anti-inflammatory doses.
- **Oral anticoagulant:** Increased risk of bleeding.
  - Piroxicam and aspirin in anti-inflammatory doses: contraindicated combination.
  - Other NSAIDs: combination not recommended. When this combination is essential, it requires close clinical and even biological monitoring.
- **Platelet antiaggregants (including aspirin at antiaggregation dose):** Increased risk of digestive haemorrhage. Patients taking aspirin at antiplatelet doses should be warned of the risks of self-medication with aspirin or another NSAID.
- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants:** Increased risk of digestive haemorrhage.
- **Diuretic, angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB II):** Risk of acute renal failure in patients at risk (elderly and/or dehydrated patients).
- **Corticosteroid therapy:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage.
- **Digoxin, Lithium, Aminoglycosides, High dose methotrexate:** Decreased renal excretion of the drug (risk of toxicity).
- **Drugs likely to promote hyperkalaemia (ACE inhibitors, ARB II, heparins, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and trimethoprim, particularly hyperkalaemic diuretics, especially when combined with each other or with potassium salts).**

### Monitoring Procedures
Regular clinical and biological monitoring in the event of prolonged prescription:
- BP, weight, oedema if history or cardiovascular or renal risk factors, or anti-hypertensive treatment.
- Digestive symptoms.
- Skin manifestations.
- Infection: serious infectious pathology should lead to discontinuation of treatment.
- Biology: haemoglobin, glomerular filtration rate, liver enzymes, pro-BNP depending on the context.",0.7,15.810000000000002,False,True,0.7293630838394165,0.6255960464477539,c,False,4,3

**Title:** Know the Principles of Treating Hyponatremia According to the Severity of Symptoms

**Description:** Evaluate the degree of urgency according to the clinical symptoms, know the principles of water restriction, and correction rules (rhythm and strategy of possible osmolar supplements).

**Rubric:** Management

**Treatment of Hyponatremia:**

- Includes aetiological treatment and symptomatic treatment, which consists of reducing excess water.
- The amount of excess water is estimated using the formula: Excess Water = 60% √ó weight √ó ([Natremia/140] - 1).

**In Chronic Hyponatremia, Priority Should Be Given to:**

- Etiological treatment (e.g., discontinuation of a drug, treatment of a cause of SIADH).
- Fluid restriction (500 mL/day) is always recommended and allows hyponatremia to be gradually corrected over several days.
- Associated symptomatic treatment, which depends on the state of the extracellular sector:
  - In the event of associated extracellular dehydration, additional NaCl intake (orally or with isotonic saline solution at 9 g/L, 0.5 to 1L/h).
  - In cases of extracellular euvolaemia due to SIADH, hyponatremia may be corrected by fluid restriction alone. If the dilution disorder is very marked (very high OsmU), fluid restriction alone may be insufficient. In this case:
    - Adding osmoles by administering urea orally (0.25 to 0.50 g/kg diluted in orange juice).
    - If these approaches fail, the use of a specific V2 ADH receptor antagonist (tolvaptan 15 to 60 mg/day orally) may be discussed if the hyponatremia is chronic and after specialist advice.
    - In cases of extracellular euvolaemia with imbalance in water intake vs. osmoles (""tea and toast"" syndrome), water restriction and/or increased osmole intake (animal proteins, NaCl) are generally sufficient.
  - In cases of associated extracellular hyperhydration: sodium restriction and loop diuretics.

**Rate of Correction:**

- The rate of correction of hyponatremia must not exceed 10 mmol/L/day for the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L for the following 24 hours (a total of 18 mmol/L over 48 hours).

**In Emergency Cases of Severe Hyponatremia (Na < 120 mOsm/kg H2O):**

- Whether acute or chronic, and responsible for moderate to severe symptoms (consciousness disorders, comitiveness, vomiting), the following regimen may be proposed:
  - Rapid infusion of hypertonic NaCl (3% NaCl 150 mL IV over 20 min, renewable 2 times depending on the control natremia), with the initial aim of increasing the natremia by 5 mmol/L.
  - NaCl 9 ‚Ä∞ (if blood volume is reduced and urinary osmolality is below 300-350 mOsm/Kg) may then be administered, with the aim of not exceeding +10 mmol/L natremia in the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L over the following 24 hours (i.e., ‚â§ 18 mmol/L over 48 hours) until 130 mmol/L is reached.
  - Monitoring in an intensive care unit is essential, as is the correction of any hypoxia.
  - In a second phase, treatment reverts to that of asymptomatic hyponatremia.
  - Associated hypokalaemia must be corrected (with KCl). This increases the risk of rapid correction of the natremia, particularly in patients with initial volume depletion (treatment with thiazides).",1.0,10.941428571428574,False,True,0.7658504843711853,0.7652042508125305,b,False,2,4

**Addiction:** A process by which a behavior, capable of producing pleasure and/or alleviating a feeling of internal discomfort, is employed with the repeated impossibility of controlling this behavior and its continuation despite the knowledge of its negative consequences.

- Consumption of psychoactive substances (substance addiction)
- Other behaviors (""non-substance addictions"" or ""behavioral addictions""): gambling, video games, sex, internet, shopping, exercise.

Corresponds to dependency.

**Non-usage:** Absence of consumption.

**Low-risk use:** Consumption of a substance or performance of a behavior that is not pathological in nature.

**High-risk use:** Levels of consumption that expose people to the risk of complications, either secondary to acute consumption (accidents or violence) or secondary to chronic consumption (physical, psychological, or social complications, transition to dependence), but these complications are not yet present (and may never be).

**Description:** Understanding the legal provisions governing prenatal diagnosis and the ethical issues involved in preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in the context of prenatal diagnosis: women, couples, and professionals faced with complex choices.

== Definitions ==

**A. Ethics and Prenatal Diagnosis (PND)**

Prenatal diagnosis (PND) was defined by the Bioethics Act of 29 July 1994 as all ""medical practices aimed at detecting a particularly serious condition in the embryo or foetus in utero."" This activity is supervised by the Agence de biom√©decine, a public body established by the law of 6 August 2004.

The main tools for PND are ultrasound and the study of foetal DNA and/or the foetal karyotype following invasive sampling (choriocentesis, amniocentesis, or cordocentesis). Ethical considerations led to the introduction of a legal framework for PND in 1994 with the Bioethics Act and its successive revisions. The law specifies the purpose of PND: ""to prevent or treat a particularly serious condition, in the interests of the unborn child.""

Advances in foetal imaging and human genetics applied to foetal medicine are highly debated. Initially focused on serious monogenic childhood diseases, prenatal diagnosis began with the detection of trisomy 21. The population concerned by prenatal diagnosis expanded due to the authorisation of termination of pregnancy for medical reasons (IMG) under the law of 17 January 1975, the development of ultrasound monitoring, and the appearance of biological techniques for assessing the risk of trisomy 21.

Progress in PND often outpaces therapy, leading to situations where recognising a disease means acknowledging the lack of available treatment, prompting some couples to request termination due to potential early or late-onset diseases.

In France, IMG is authorised ""at any time during pregnancy,"" and the law avoids automatic decision-making by not listing diseases that qualify for IMG. Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, considering the context and individual situations.

CPDPNs face requests for IMGs for late-onset genetic diseases, such as foetuses carrying the BRCA 1 gene. The legitimacy of certain requests is questioned, especially regarding the criteria for terminating a pregnancy. The debate includes the acceptance of disability in society and the quality of life for individuals with varying levels of awareness and autonomy.

The ethical process of deciding on pregnancy termination involves questioning terms like ""high probability,"" ""incurability,"" and ""particular seriousness,"" which are subjective and vary among individuals. Ongoing dialogue with the couple is crucial, requiring time and energy from multidisciplinary teams.

**B. The Specific Case of Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS)**

Since 2013, non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPT) for trisomy 21 has been available in France. This test uses foetal DNA circulating in the mother's blood, allowing earlier detection (around eight to ten weeks' amenorrhoea) with high sensitivity and specificity.

NIPT is revolutionising PND by enabling the study of other foetal genome characteristics. Current debates focus on access conditions for this test, including the search for other anomalies or sex diagnosis.

The implementation of foetal DNA analysis in maternal blood should be subject to applied research to understand professional and patient perceptions. The globalisation of healthcare access and e-health may lead women to conduct tests independently, necessitating new frameworks and rules.

The development of NIPT raises questions about its impact on pregnancy termination requests. The possibility of conducting the test before the first trimester's end challenges the distinction between abortion and IMG in French law. The ethical framework changes if results are communicated before 16 weeks' gestation, potentially leading to abortion requests based on biological results.

Healthcare professionals need clarity on the future status of NIPT in pregnancy monitoring. While few professionals oppose prescribing the test, debates continue on its legitimate indications and associated questions.

**Key Points**

- PND is designed to detect serious conditions in the embryo or foetus, allowing parents to decide on pregnancy termination and better medical management if continued.
- When a foetal anomaly is detected, the CPDPN certifies the probability of a serious, incurable condition, enabling medical termination if the pregnant woman decides.
- NIPS allows early selection of foetal sex or genetic screening for pathology markers. Careful targeting of indications and timing of result communication is necessary, especially concerning voluntary termination limits.",0.8571428571428571,10.562500000000004,False,True,0.8495311737060547,0.7464374105135599,d,False,3,3

== Definitions ==

**Urine Dipstick**  
The urine dipstick (BU) is used for screening after the age of 1 month. Before that, the prevalence is too high to rule out a UTI if there are any suggestive signs. The BU reveals leucocyturia (> 10,000/mL) and the presence of nitrites, unless the UTI is caused by a bacterium that does not produce nitrate reductase, such as Enterococcus.

**ECBU**  
Used to confirm the diagnosis after the BU for children over 1 month old. It is indicated systematically, even if BU is negative, in children under 1 month of age and in the event of signs of seriousness. It includes a direct examination after Gram staining, which can help in microbiological orientation for the choice of empirical antibiotic therapy, followed by a culture. The results are interpreted according to the method of collection.

- Jet stream or borehole: >= 1000 UFC/mL  
- Pocket: >= 10,000 UFC/mL  
- Suprapubic puncture (rarely done in practice): >= 100 UFC/mL  
- Multi-microbial culture indicates contamination  

**Collection Method**  
The method of collection determines the quality of the sample and the reliability of the BU.

- Jet environment: Preferable, but difficult before potty training. Perineal stimulation with cold water compresses can induce urination in infants.
- Before potty training age:
  - ""Round trip"" bladder catheterization
  - Bag sampling (adhesive catheter): Exposes the patient to the risk of contamination, requires rigorous disinfection, and urine should be collected less than 30 minutes after the bag is inserted.

In practice, after 1 month and in the absence of signs of severity and risk factors for complicated infection, if midstream sampling fails, urine can be collected in a bag for BU. If BU is negative, the diagnosis can be ruled out. If the BU is positive on a bag left in place for more than 30 minutes, an A/R catheterization may be suggested.

**Imaging Examinations**  
Renal and urinary tract ultrasound should be performed systematically for the first episode of ANP to look for uropathy and lesions of the renal parenchyma, or in the event of recurrent cystitis. Cystography should be discussed. Other examinations, such as scintigraphy and MRI, are reserved for special cases and require specialist opinion.

**Biological Tests**  
If NAP is suspected:

- Inflammatory markers:
  - CPT: Associated with risk of UTR
  - CRP: May help to correct a diagnosis if CRP is low after more than 24-48 hours of fever.
- Blood culture: < 3 months and/or signs of sepsis
- LP: Systematic if blood culture is positive, with a broad indication before 6 weeks due to the risk of associated bacteremia and secondary meningitis.",0.6153846153846154,15.400000000000002,False,True,0.8502135872840881,0.6511178612709045,b,False,4,4

**Extrinsic properties of the test**: depend on the prevalence of the disease in the population studied.

- Positive predictive value (PPV) of a test: probability of being ill if the test is positive.
- Negative predictive value (NPV) of a test: probability of not being ill if the test is negative.

**Intrinsic properties of the test**: do not depend on the prevalence of the disease in the population studied.

- Sensitivity of a test (Se): probability of having a positive test if one is ill.
- Specificity of a test (Sp): probability of having a negative test if one is not ill.
- Positive likelihood ratio (PLR): ratio of the probability of the test being positive in a sick patient to the probability of the test being positive in a healthy patient.
- Negative likelihood ratio (NLR): ratio of the probability that the test is negative in a sick patient to the probability that the test is negative in a healthy patient.

**Assessment of the decision-making input**

- Pre-test probability that an individual is ill: formed a priori (implicitly from the subjective impression of the doctor or explicitly from the estimated prevalence of the disease or clinical prediction models).
- Post-test probability that an individual is ill: probability revised a posteriori, based on the results of the test.
- Fagan's nomogram: graphically indicates the post-test probability of being ill from the pre-test probability, the test result, and the likelihood ratios corresponding to this result (a way of expressing the intrinsic performance of the test, calculated from its sensitivity and specificity).

When a TDS is mentioned, differential diagnoses must be ruled out because the clinical symptoms are not very specific:

- Thyroid pathology: Hypothyroidism (243)
- A hypothalamic central involvement: Pituitary adenoma (244)
- Prolactin adenoma
- Iatrogenic hypogonadism (spironolactone, ketoconazole, flutamide, cyproterone, etc.)
- Hypogonadism secondary to another pathology (haemochromatosis, Cushing's disease, cirrhosis (279), pathological obesity (253), hypopituitarism (244), etc.)
- Natural ageing (123)

In the event of a confirmed diagnosis of TDS, initial treatment will be based on natural testosterone supplementation via the transdermal or intramuscular route. The management of all symptoms secondary to TDS must not be forgotten, including osteoporosis (123), brittle osteopathies (128), and metabolic syndrome (222).",0.75,17.416470588235295,False,True,0.8697925806045532,0.5385143061478933,d,False,4,3

**Rubric:** Support  

In France, legislation on the protection of persons undergoing biomedical research was introduced in 1988 with the Huriet-S√©rusclat law.

== Prior to 1988 ==  
Research was conducted in semi-clandestine conditions, with a low level of control, non-comparative trials, and no written protocol. Trials on non-patients were illegal. Approvals were granted based on expert opinion. From 1975 onwards, demands for scientific proof and rigorous methodologies began to emerge.

== Loi Huriet-S√©rusclat (20 December 1988) ==  
This law sets out the principle of equality for all participants, whether sick or not. The terms ""protection of individuals"" are preferred to ""human experimentation."" It establishes two types of research: with direct individual benefit and without direct individual benefit. Constraints are heavier for the second type: it is necessary to obtain authorization from the research sites, and the promoter may be held liable, even without fault.

Consent must be ""free, informed and express,"" in accordance with international texts. Special protection is sought for ""vulnerable"" persons. In keeping with the principle that the human body should be free of charge, the ""non-commercialization"" of the human body is affirmed. No remuneration is possible, but ""compensation"" for participants ""without direct individual benefit"" who are not hospitalized is possible.

The law provides for the creation of Consultative Committees for the Protection of Individuals in Biomedical Research (CCPPRB), independent of the administrative authority. Research will not be possible if it is not based on the latest state of knowledge, if it is not preceded by sufficient pre-clinical experimentation, if there is a foreseeable risk out of all proportion to the expected benefit, if it does not aim to extend scientific knowledge of human beings and the means likely to improve their condition, if it is not designed to reduce pain, fear, or discomfort. All these conditions are cumulative.

It can only be carried out under the direction and supervision of an experienced doctor. The material and technical conditions must be appropriate to the trial and compatible with the requirements of scientific rigor and personal safety. The interests of the patient must always take precedence over the sole interests of science and society.

This law is beneficial in that it provides legal certainty for investigators and requires prior examination of protocols and informed consent. However, a number of difficulties remain: it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a study has direct benefit or not, and the protection afforded to patients is worse than that afforded to healthy volunteers.

== Law of 9 August 2004 ==  
This law transposes the 2001 European directive on clinical trials. It defines biomedical research: ""Biomedical research is research organized and carried out on human beings with a view to developing biological or medical knowledge."" Research occurs when, over and above the act of providing care and the immediate interests of the patient, the doctor seeks to advance scientific knowledge, i.e., to identify and formalize general teaching. This applies not only to the testing of techniques and products but also to cognitive research.

The notions of direct or indirect benefit have been abandoned in favor of the notion of interventional and non-interventional trials. Non-interventional trials are excluded from the reform (observational survey, epidemiology). Research into routine care is subject to simplified procedures. Protocols are assessed based on the benefit/risk balance rather than the therapeutic benefit. Protection is strengthened and the different protection regimes disappear.

The roles of the various players are well defined. The promoter is the natural or legal person who initiates the research, manages it, and verifies its funding. The investigator is the natural person who directs and supervises the conduct of the research on a given site. Where there are several investigators, a coordinator is appointed.

The Committees for the Protection of Individuals (CPP) replace the CCPPRB. The CPP is made up of fourteen members in two colleges. The medical college comprises four people qualified in research, including at least two doctors and one epidemiologist or biostatistician, one general practitioner, one hospital pharmacist, and one nurse. The societal college is made up of a person qualified in ethics, a psychologist, a social worker, two persons qualified in legal matters, and two representatives of associations (article R.1123-4 of the Public Health Code).

The opinion of the CPP becomes necessary and favorable. It is decision-making and no longer advisory. This opinion takes into account the information provided to the subject (time for reflection, adequacy, completeness, and intelligibility of written information, oral information supported by a written text), the title of the protocol, the contact details of the sponsor and coordinating investigator, the objective, methodology and duration of the research, the expected benefits, the constraints and foreseeable risks, medical alternatives, care arrangements at the end of the research, access to results at the end of the research, confidentiality of data, the date of the opinion of the CPP and the authorization of the competent authority and the insurance certificate issued by the sponsor. This opinion also takes account of the written consent obtained by the investigator, which must be free and informed. There are special cases: in the case of minors, consent is obtained from the legal representative; in the case of persons unable to express themselves, it is obtained from the trusted support person or the guardianship judge; in an emergency, it is obtained from the family or the trusted support person if they are present. The CPP's opinion is also based on the relevance of the research (scientific, methodological, and ethical), the match between the objectives and the resources deployed, the satisfactory nature of the assessment of the expected benefits and risks, and the soundness of the conclusions, the procedures for recruiting participants, the amount and procedures for compensating participants, registration on the National Volunteer Register (Internet) to prevent abuse, compliance with an exclusion period between two research studies, the quality of the research sites, and the qualifications of the investigators.

The French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) has become the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines (ANSM). For products other than medicinal products, the competent authority is the Direction G√©n√©rale de la Sant√© (DGS). The declaration system is replaced by an authorization system. Authorization is valid for one year. The ANSM may request additional information or suspend research.

Subjects taking part in the research must undergo a prior medical examination, be affiliated with a social security scheme, be registered in the national database, and have access to the overall results and information relating to their state of health. They may receive compensation, subject to a ceiling, for the constraints they have undergone or for the damage they have suffered (by the sponsor in the event of negligence or by a compensation fund in the absence of negligence). They may not take part in more than one research project at the same time.

Patient associations and health system users are represented on the CPPs. Overall research results must be communicated. They may be included in national and European research databases (unless the sponsor objects).

== Law of 5 March 2012 (Jard√© Law) ==  
In the law of 5 March 2012, also known as the ""law on research involving the human person"" (RIPH), the term ""biomedical research"" has been removed. It aims to provide a single framework for medical research and simplify the procedures involved. It distinguishes between three types of research: interventional research with risk, interventional research with negligible risk (aimed at evaluating routine care), and non-interventional or observational research.

Types of research defined by the law on research involving the human person:

=== 1st Category: Interventional Research Involving an Intervention on a Person Not Justified by Usual Care ===  
In risky interventional research, the intervention on the individual is not justified by his or her usual care (use of a new molecule, for example). Consent must be free, informed, and express, and given in writing.

This research focuses on:

- Medicinal products
- Other health products (mentioned in article L.5311-1 of the French Public Health Code)
- Foodstuffs

Terms and conditions:

- Authorization from the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam for research involving medicinal products
- Favourable opinion from the CPP (Committee for the Protection of Individuals)
- Specific insurance cover taken out by the sponsor
- Formalities with the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert√©s (CNIL; for example, commitment to comply with the MR001 reference methodology)
- EudraCT number (used to identify each study carried out in the European Union; the sponsor must request this number from the European Medicines Agency)

=== 2nd Category: Interventional Research Involving Only Minimal Risks and Constraints ===  
Negligible-risk interventional research does not involve medicinal products and presents minimal risks and constraints. Consent must be free, informed, and express, and may be obtained orally.

Terms and conditions:

- Favourable opinion from a CPP
- No authorization from the Agence nationale de s√©curit√© du m√©dicament (ANSM), but information (summary and opinion of the CPP sent)
- Insurance taken out by the sponsor
- CNIL procedures
- Research registration number (the sponsor must request this from the Agence nationale de s√©curit√© du m√©dicament)
- Be part of the list established by the Order of 12 April 2018

Research in the second category involves healthy or sick people. The minimal nature of the risks and constraints associated with carrying out the procedure(s) is assessed in light of:

- Gender
- Age
- Physical condition
- The pathology, if any, of the person undergoing the research
- Frequency and duration

Such research may involve the use of health products, but these are then used under the usual conditions of use. It may involve minimally invasive procedures (venous blood sampling, non-invasive imaging, etc.).

=== 3rd Category: Non-Interventional Research ===  
Non-interventional research involves no risks or constraints. All procedures are carried out and all products are used in the usual way.

The subject must be informed and his or her non-opposition must be sought.

Terms and conditions:

- Favourable opinion from a CPP
- No authorization from the ANSM but information (summary and CPP opinion sent)
- Application to the CNIL

The CPP is involved in all types of research, and its opinion must be favorable for all three types.

The territorial jurisdiction of the CPPs has been abolished, and the CPPs come under the supervision of a National Commission for Research Involving the Human Person, which is responsible for coordinating, harmonizing, and assessing the practices of the CPPs. The CPP will make its decision within forty-five days. If the CPP remains silent after this period, the application is rejected.

Research involving retrospective data (e.g., theses on medical files) is excluded from this framework as it does not concern individuals but data. Such research is subject solely to the opinion of the CNIL, which is based on a prior opinion from the Comit√© d'expertise pour les recherches, les √©tudes et les √©valuations dans le domaine de la sant√© (CEREES).

The different players:

- The French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM):
  - Is responsible for the methodology of first category trials (after implementation of the BR)
  - Issues a registration number for the first, second, and third categories of research. Note: the EUDRACT number for interventional research involving a medicinal product is provided by the European Medicines Agency, the ID-RCB number is provided by the ANSM for all other research
  - Receives the summary and the opinion of the CPP for second and third category research

- The National Commission for Research Involving the Human Person (CNRIPH), created in 2018, is responsible for coordinating, harmonizing, and evaluating the practices of the CPPs.
- The Committee for the Protection of Individuals (CPP) is made up of fourteen full members divided into two colleges.
- The promoter is the natural person or legal entity responsible for research involving human subjects, who manages the project and ensures that it is financed. The sponsor or its legal representative must be established in the European Union. The sponsor is usually a pharmaceutical laboratory, a research center, or a health establishment such as a university hospital.
- The investigator is the natural person(s) who directs and supervises the conduct of the research on a site. This is most often a doctor.

== Ethical Issues ==  
Despite the strict normative framework for research, unpredictable situations, harmful effects, and unethical drifts can still be observed.

The principle of protecting vulnerable populations can have a paradoxical effect by excluding these populations from clinical trials, and therefore denying them access to new therapies. In this case, equity in access to care is not respected.

In some studies, the adverse effect, which had not been observed in animals, causes significant damage in human subjects because it is specific to humans. This unpredictable adverse effect occurs even though the research has been properly conducted following a test in animals.

How can we be sure that informed consent is genuine when the subject is illiterate or does not understand the language, when the subject is a child, or when the subject is incapable of giving consent? What is the value of the consent obtained? There can be no remuneration, but expenses may be reimbursed. Is there any form of control in this case? When the products studied are marketed, will their cost guarantee fair access for all? What will be the accessibility of the product for subjects who wanted to or had to withdraw from the study?

Many questions remain, despite all the attention paid to subjects suitable for biomedical research.

**Key Points**

- Research involving human subjects is subject to strict legal supervision. This framework is essential to enable research to develop while respecting individuals.
- Since 2012, there has been a single legislative framework for all research involving humans. Research is classified into three types depending on whether or not it is interventional and on the risk involved.
- The roles of the players involved in a research protocol are well defined (investigator, sponsor).
- The personal protection committees play an important role and provide a decision-making opinion.

The thymus is a soft lympho-epithelial organ located in the anterior superior mediastinum, consisting of two lobes connected by an isthmus. Its appearance varies with age: it develops rapidly from birth, is generally voluminous in infants, and then begins to involute around the age of 1 year, disappearing completely after the age of 40. In certain situations (corticosteroid therapy, chemotherapy, infections, etc.), the thymus may decrease in size and then regrow (""thymic rebound"") when the clinical condition improves.

**Normal Radiological Appearance on a Frontal Chest View:** (no systematic profile view)

- Bilateral and asymmetric opacity of the anterior superior mediastinum, inseparable from the cardiac mass.
- Variable shape, often asymmetric, with clear contours, non-compressive on adjacent structures.
- Hydrous and homogeneous tone.
- Specific morphologies frequently found: sail sign, wave sign, connection sign, hilar overlay sign.

**Descriptions of Specific Morphologies:**

- **Sail Sign:** Triangular opacity on the right side of the mediastinum, with clear contours, the lower edge of which rests on the horizontal scissure, in association with hypertrophy of the right lobe of the thymus, giving a boat sail appearance. This is a classic sign but quite rare (5% of thymuses), more frequent on the right than on the left, and sometimes bilateral.
  
- **Wave Sign:** The left outer edge of the thymus appears wavy related to invagination of the thymus into the intercostal spaces. This is a typical sign of a soft, anterior organ such as the thymus.
  
- **Connection Sign:** There is an incision at the point of connection between the outer edge of the hypertrophic left lobe of the thymus overlying the cardiac silhouette, and the left edge of the heart. This is a typical sign of an anterior mediastinal opacity.
  
- **Hilar Overlay Sign:** The vessels of the pulmonary hilum (middle mediastinum) are visible through the thymic opacity (anterior mediastinum), whereas they would be repressed if it were a cardiomegaly.",0.5714285714285714,12.407777777777778,False,True,0.8436046838760376,0.7504952351252238,b,False,2,4

== Definitions ==

**A. Tremor**  
Involuntary rhythmic oscillation of all or part of the body around its position of equilibrium. There are two main types of tremor: those which occur in muscles at rest and those which occur in activated muscles (i.e., in action) with postural and intentional components often associated.

**B. Chorea**  
Sudden, random, anarchic movement, often of the rotation or flexion/extension type, non-stereotyped, arrhythmic, without purpose, affecting various territories (face, neck, trunk, limbs), present at rest and in action, occurring against a background of hypotonia. When this type of movement is proximal (affecting the roots of the limbs) and has a large amplitude, it is referred to as ballismus (most often linked to a vascular lesion of the subthalamic nucleus).

**C. Dystonia**  
Involuntary, prolonged muscle contractions responsible for abnormal posture and/or repetitive movements, aggravated by movements in the vicinity of the affected area and stereotyped. It may involve abnormal posture and/or movement. Dystonia is a cause of localised or generalised muscle contracture, which can give the impression of joint stiffness.

- **Focal dystonia:** A segment of the body is affected, as in spasmodic torticollis (also known as cervical dystonia, characterised by torsion of the neck), blepharospasm (focal dystonia responsible for palpebral anomaly) linked to dystonia of the orbicular muscles of the eyelids and characterised by abnormal, iterative, and prolonged occlusions of the eyelids.
- **Functional dystonia:** Dystonia occurs during a particular gesture or function (e.g., writer's cramp, musician's cramp).
- **Haemidonia:** Damage to one of the hemi-bodies.
- **Generalised dystonia:** Involvement of at least one lower limb and the trunk.

**D. Myoclonus**  
Sudden muscle jerks originating in the central nervous system. They may be segmental (focal or multifocal) or generalised, isolated (arrhythmic) or repetitive (rhythmic, giving the impression of an irregular tremor). These muscular jerks are positive myoclonias, whereas negative myoclonias are sudden resolutions of muscle tone (as in asterixis or ""flapping tremor""). Myoclonus may be cortical, subcortical (linked to dysfunction of the basal ganglia), reticular, pontine, or spinal in origin.

**E. Tics**  
A tic is a sudden, brief, intermittent, stereotyped movement without purpose (a ""caricature of a normal gesture""), which is repetitive. It may be preceded by a premonitory sensation (internal sensation of the need to move preceding the tic) and can be controlled by the will for a few minutes at the cost of increasing internal tension and a rebound phenomenon occurring after the control effort. The tic is the most frequent abnormal movement.

- **Simple tics:** Involving just a few muscles (blinking, shaking the head, shrugging the shoulders, etc.).
- **Complex tics:** Involving an elaborate motor sequence (putting the right hand under the left armpit and adducting the left shoulder to crush the right hand).

Motor tics are the opposite of vocal tics (screaming, sniffing, throat clearing, forced exhalation, etc.), which may, rarely, correspond to obscenities known as coprolalia.

- Clinical manifestation with the same mechanism as syncope, but the duration of cerebral hypoperfusion is too short to cause complete loss of consciousness.
- Imminent sensation of syncope without loss of consciousness: prodromes without syncope.

Comitial or epileptic seizure (Convulsion SDD-120, Coma and consciousness disorders SDD-028, Malaise/loss of consciousness SDD-050):

- Clinical manifestation linked to the synchronous paroxysmal hyperactivity of cortical neurons and to the propagation of this activity.
- Only generalized seizures cause loss of consciousness:
  - Absence with loss of consciousness lasting a few tens of seconds.
  - Generalized tonic-clonic seizure with prolonged loss of consciousness lasting ten to several tens of minutes, including the seizure itself and the post-critical confusion phase.
- Usually gradual regaining of consciousness in the emergency vehicle or at the emergency room.

Urinary colonisation, also known as asymptomatic bacteriuria, is the presence of bacteria in the urine without any symptoms. It is very common among elderly patients, diabetics, and in certain situations, such as patients with indwelling endo-urinary equipment. It should not be treated except in special cases, such as patients undergoing urological surgery in contact with urine and pregnant women.

Colonisation depends on many factors and is not inherently pathological. The urinary microbiota may change depending on the clinical situation, without this being a warning sign. The ECBU is an examination that does not reveal all the bacteria present in urine, which explains why urine has been called ""sterile"" for decades.

**Main Complications:**

The primary complications of atopic dermatitis are infectious:

- **Superinfection by Staphylococcus aureus:** This is clinically difficult to diagnose. Indicators include the presence of purulent discharge, vesiculo-bullous lesions, and melicoid crusts. **Caution:** Light yellow oozing from acute lesions is not a sign of superinfection.

- **Superinfection with Herpes Virus (HSV-1):** Although classic, it is rare, occurring in about 5% of cases. It can occur after a primary infection in young children, following a herpetic recurrence, or after contact with an infected person (e.g., children kissed by an adult with a herpetic recurrence). Clinically, it presents as a sudden worsening with the appearance of multiple vesicular lesions that rapidly progress to punctiform, umbilicated skin erosions. **Note:** This is an emergency situation that contraindicates the use of dermocorticoids and requires the rapid initiation of antiviral treatment (aciclovir orally or intravenously if there is extensive involvement or if the oral route is impossible). The dosage is the same for adults and children aged 2 and over.

## 1. Identify Possible Factors Favoring a Migraine

- **Triggers:** Factors that, singly or in combination, trigger attacks in a migraine sufferer. Most patients describe several triggers. The common denominator is a change, either intrinsic (endogenous) or extrinsic (exogenous):
  - Modifying meals and hydration (timing, quantity, and/or quality)
  - Changes to sleep patterns (quality, duration, wake-up, and bedtimes)
  - Climate changes (atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity)
  - Hormonal changes (catamenial period, resumption of post-partum migraines)
  - Intense and unusual physical effort
  - Negative emotions (anger, annoyance) or positive emotions (birthdays, weddings)
  - Stress and periods of relaxation (weekends, holidays)
  - Pharmacological triggers (alcohol, phosphodiesterase inhibitors)

- The real triggers are often obvious (alcohol, catamenial period).

- **Hygienic and Dietetic Rules:** For patients with an unfavorable lifestyle, but these rules will never cure the migraine.

- Unnecessary avoidance of real or supposed triggers can reduce quality of life and even increase sensitivity to triggers, making migraine worse.

## 2. Identify and Prevent Possible Risk Factors for Progression to Chronic Migraine

Migraine comorbidities are conditions that are more prevalent in migraine sufferers than in control subjects: anxiety, depression, sleep disorders (SD-135), asthma, chronic pain (SD-035) non-headache, cardiovascular disease. These comorbidities and other risk factors increase the risk of an episodic migraine developing into a chronic migraine. Treating them can help to improve migraine. They should therefore be screened for and prevention and/or treatment offered.

### Migraine Risk Factors and Prevention

#### Risk Factors for the Transition from an Episodic Form to a Chronic Migraine

- **Socio-demographic Factors**
  - Female gender, low household income: Not modifiable
  - Sedentary lifestyle: Education, encouraging physical activity

**Rubric:** Definition

== I- Evolution of the Rule of Law and the Law on the End of Life ==

To understand what is at stake and how the end of life is dealt with, we need to know how society's view of the issue has evolved, as reflected in changes in the law.

- The circular of 26 August 1986, known as the ""Laroque"" circular, defined palliative care for the first time in France as ""support care"" aimed at meeting the specific needs of people at the end of their lives.

- The law of 9 June 1999 guaranteed the right of access to palliative care, defining it as ""active and continuous care provided by an interdisciplinary team in an institution or at home, aiming to relieve pain, alleviate physical suffering, safeguard the dignity of the sick person, and support those around them.""

- The law of 4 March 2002, known as the ""Kouchner law,"" emphasized patients' rights, placing the individual at the center of decision-making concerning their health. It introduced the possibility of appointing a ""trusted support person"" to be consulted if the patient is unable to express their opinion.

- The law of 22 April 2005, known as the ""L√©onetti law,"" reaffirmed the right of every person to refuse treatment and recognized the possibility for doctors to limit or stop care if they cannot relieve the suffering of a person in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease. It introduced the concept of advance directives.

- The law of 2 February 2016, known as the ""Claeys-L√©onetti law,"" created new rights for patients at the end of life, including the right to ""deep and continuous sedation"" for patients suffering from a serious and incurable disease. Euthanasia and assisted suicide remain prohibited in France.

The law addresses two medical situations: limiting care and stopping care, both designed to avoid unreasonable obstinacy.

- Limitation means refraining from using means likely to prolong a life in serious danger.
- Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment involves suspending life-sustaining treatment in progress, such as artificial respiration.

In all cases, the issue of information and consent is central. Decisions may be taken at the patient's request, and it is essential to know the patient's feelings and last wishes.

When patients are unconscious or have reduced capacity for expression and comprehension, incorporating their opinion and consent into decision-making is highly problematic. Possible approaches include:

- Advance directives, which allow mentally competent people to establish in advance how they would like to be treated in the event of hospitalization.
- Testimony from relatives or the trusted support person, although this raises questions about reliability and hierarchy.

Healthcare professionals have a duty to act collegially, and the limitation or cessation of treatment cannot occur without a collegial procedure and consultation with the patient's advance directives or trusted support person.

== II- Place and Role of the Trusted Support Person at the End of Life ==

The right to appoint a trusted support person was enshrined in the French Public Health Code following the law of 4 March 2002. The trusted support person assists the patient in their care, supports them physically and/or psychologically, and acts as a link with medical teams. This role is crucial in both standard care and major crisis situations, such as stopping or limiting care at the end of life.

== III- Drawing Up End-of-Life Advance Directives ==

The law of 22 April 2005 introduced the possibility of refusing care if it appears ""useless, disproportionate, or having no effect other than the artificial maintenance of life."" The 2016 law strengthened the rights of patients at the end of life and emphasized the role of advance directives.

In practice, there are two scenarios:

1) If the patient is aware and capable, they will be involved in the decision-making process with the doctor.
2) For patients unable to express their wishes, the doctor may decide to limit or stop treatment after consulting the trusted support person, family, and advance directives.

Advance directives originated in the United States to incorporate patients' opinions into end-of-life decision-making. In France, the 2005 law introduced this system to ensure professionals offer it to patients and check for directives when deciding to stop or limit treatment.

The 2016 law reiterated the patient's right to refuse treatment and established a hierarchy for tracing a patient's wishes: advance directives, testimony of the trusted support person, and testimony from family or close friends.

**What the Law on the End of Life Emphasizes:**

- Professionals should discuss the law on the end of life, advance directives, and their place in relation to the trusted support person with patients.
- Healthcare professionals must ensure every person has the right to a dignified end of life with the best possible alleviation of suffering.
- Recognition of a patient's right to stop or limit treatment as part of the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy.
- Doctors must respect the patient's wish to refuse treatment after informing them of the consequences.
- A greater role for doctors in informing patients about drawing up advance directives and appointing a trusted support person.
- The need for collegial decision-making.
- Advance directives are now enforceable, and doctors must follow them if appropriate to the medical situation.
- A hierarchy exists for tracing a patient's wishes: advance directives, testimony of the trusted support person, and testimony from family or close friends.",0.8,11.68,False,True,0.7506150007247925,0.715114156405131,c,False,5,3

Fetal damage is proportional to the quantity of alcohol ingested.

There are three main types of consumption, regardless of the type of drink involved (a drink containing approximately 10g of pure alcohol):

- **Heavy consumption:** More than 2 drinks per day. The fetal impact is well documented, with a risk of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS).

- **Occasional, light, or moderate consumption:** Around 1 to 2 drinks per day. There is no dysmorphic or malformative syndrome. In the case of occasional or light alcohol consumption, the scientific data are reassuring regarding the occurrence of long-term cognitive or behavioral problems. In the case of moderate drinking, studies are contradictory, but there is a risk of alteration in behavioral scores, as well as affective and/or anxiety disorders.

**Description:** Understanding the sources of funding for social protection.

Social security contributions are compulsory payments made by self-employed persons, employees, and employers to acquire entitlement to social security benefits. These contributions cover health, maternity, disability, and death insurance; old age insurance; unemployment insurance; and family allowances. There is also the ""contribution solidarit√© autonomie"" (CSA, or solidarity day) payable by public and private employers who are liable for the employer's health insurance contribution.

Social security contributions account for the bulk of social protection resources. However, since 1990, the proportion of social security contributions in social welfare funding has been declining in favor of fiscal resources, such as the CSG (general social contribution), and exemptions on employers' contributions. Earmarked taxes account for a growing proportion of social protection resources. They include:

- Transfers of tax resources paid on a permanent basis to social security schemes (particularly the farmers' scheme).
- Taxes on products (e.g., taxes on alcohol, tobacco, motor insurance).
- Taxes on wages and labor.
- Taxes on income and wealth, which is the largest proportion of social protection tax resources. They include the CSG and the contribution to the repayment of the social debt (CRDS).

State public contributions finance solidarity spending (RSA, old age solidarity fund), part of the exemptions from employer contributions, and subsidize schemes.

The origin of social protection resources, particularly in pension schemes where the number of active contributors is less than the number of pensioners, is illustrated in a graph. The breakdown of social protection resources by type of levy in 2020 shows a decline in the share of social contributions due to the drop in professional activity during 2020 (confinements). This highlights the importance of economic activity in generating financial resources for social protection.

**Title:** Knowing the Definition of Liability, Penalties, and Compensation

**Rubric:** Definition

The liability of a healthcare professional or institution may be sought for two purposes: either to penalize the professional or institution, or to compensate a user who has suffered the consequences of an adverse event associated with healthcare. The penalty may be criminal or disciplinary in nature. Compensation is the responsibility of the person responsible (self-employed) or their employer if they are employed (public or private). It may also be obtained through an amicable procedure before the conciliation and compensation commissions. Compensation for victims is ensured by the obligation for doctors and health establishments (public or private) to take out professional indemnity insurance. In addition to providing compensation for victims, this insurance covers salaried doctors when the fault is detachable from the service or when the mission entrusted to them is exceeded.

In order to receive compensation for the harmful consequences of a medical act, a user must prove that the act caused the damage, that it gave rise to liability, and that there was a causal link between the act and the damage.

In terms of the liability of healthcare professionals and establishments, damage can take several forms. It may be:

- Physical or mental injury
- Loss of chance of survival or recovery
- A loss of opportunity to have escaped a risk that ultimately materialized (in the case of failure to provide information)

The damage must be present and certain. It may be future if it is certain (for example, the sterility of a child as a result of faulty irradiation).

The causal link between the event giving rise to liability (generally fault) and the damage must be certain. It need not be direct or exclusive.

Of the three elements of liability, causation is usually the most difficult for patients to prove. It is often difficult to distinguish the consequences of the fault from those of the spontaneous evolution of the pathological state of health. The courts accept that compensation may be awarded for loss of chance of survival or recovery. In this case, compensation is awarded in proportion to the probability of survival or recovery lost as a result of the fault.

The same reasoning applies in the case of a failure to provide information. In this case, the patient has lost a chance to escape the risk that ultimately materialized. In other words, if they had been informed of the risk, they could have chosen to run it or to forego the medical procedure. Compensation is awarded in proportion to the probability that the patient would have had of foregoing the procedure if he had been informed of the risk. As a result, if the procedure was essential, the judge concludes that even if the patient had been informed of the risk, he would not have decided to undergo the procedure. The loss of chance is therefore zero.

The courts and the administrative courts also accept that a failure to provide information gives rise to a right to compensation for loss of preparation, as distinct from loss of opportunity. When the risk of which the patient was unaware actually materializes, this compensation compensates the patient for any inconvenience he or she may have suffered as a result of not being able to prepare for this eventuality, in particular by making certain personal arrangements.",0.6923076923076923,19.351428571428574,False,True,0.7945123910903931,0.957616905371348,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Knowing the Effects of Menopause in the Short, Medium, and Long Term

**Description:** None

The effects of menopause in the short, medium, and long term are significant and varied.

---

**Short-term Effects**

**Climacteric Syndrome**

Climacteric symptoms are detailed in the initial sections of the file.

**Genitourinary Menopause Syndrome (GUMS)**

Three groups of disorders make up this syndrome:

- Vulvovaginal symptoms: dryness (78%), burning and irritation (30%)
- Sexual symptoms: dyspareunia (31%)
- Urinary symptoms: pain on urination, repeated infections (5 to 17%), pollakiuria, nocturia, urge incontinence (15 to 35% in women over 60)

The clinical symptoms of MGS worsen with age and the duration of menopause but decrease with the frequency of sexual intercourse. The overall prevalence of the syndrome varies widely, ranging from 10% to 70% of post-menopausal women. The diagnosis of MGS is mainly clinical; a single symptom is sufficient to describe this syndrome.

---

**Medium and Long-term Effects**

**Postmenopausal Osteoporosis**

**Definition**

Osteoporosis is defined as a state of diffuse skeletal fragility linked to a reduction in mineral mass and alterations in bone microarchitecture, which may be complicated by fractures following minor trauma. The most typical fractures are wrist fractures, vertebral compression, and femoral neck fractures.

**Tissue Consequences of Menopause**

Estrogen deficiency causes osteoclastic hyperactivity, leading to accelerated bone loss. The risk of osteoporosis depends on the woman's bone stock at the time of menopause and the rate of post-menopausal bone loss.

**Screening Women at Risk**

- Measurement of bone capital at two reference sites (lumbar spine and upper end of femur) by osteodensitometry using the reference technique of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Any subject will be considered osteoporotic when their bone mineral density value is less than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for young adults (T-score < -2.5).
- Other fracture risk factors and study of bone remodeling (markers).

**Cardiovascular Disease**

Epidemiological data have clearly established that the onset of menopause, whether natural or surgical, is associated with a loss of the advantage that women have over men regarding cardiovascular disease. The disturbances underlying this risk include:

- Metabolic disturbances affecting lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, insulin metabolism, fat mass distribution, and haemostasis disturbances.
- Direct alterations in the structure and reactivity of the vascular wall, with estrogen deficiency reducing arterial vasoreactivity and promoting the progression of atherosclerosis.

**Screening Women at Risk**

In practice, screening for cardiovascular risk is still based on the search for traditional risk factors, with menopause constituting an additional risk factor. A number of emerging risk factors specific to women also contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in women after menopause (gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, migraines with aura, etc.).",1.0,17.652222222222225,False,True,0.7374287247657776,0.6135749816894531,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Prevention: Understanding the Prevention of Errors, EIAS, the Concept of the Safety Barrier.

**Description:** None

The management of errors and complaints is an essential element in the prevention of risks associated with healthcare. It is an a posteriori approach to risk. A risk has occurred resulting in harm to a patient. This harm may be real or perceived by the patient.

An in-depth analysis of errors and the reasons for complaints will enable us to identify ways of preventing further errors by implementing improvement measures.

**Basics of In-Depth Analysis of Error Causes**

**Reason's Model**

Reason's model (or the Swiss cheese model) is the model most often presented. It highlights the latent causes of an accident, distinguishing between active and latent errors. This helps us understand that human error is often a consequence of deeper organizational flaws. This model proposes an analysis of undesirable events in successive sequences where different levels of defense at each stage have been overcome. This concept of successive barriers has now been replaced by a systemic model, which is too complex to be detailed here.

**Safety Barriers**

Barriers are in-depth defenses (protections) against the risk of error. There are three types of safety barriers:

- Prevention barriers
- Recovery barriers
- Mitigation barriers

An effective safety system must have all three. Neither recovery nor mitigation barriers should be neglected.

These three types of barriers can be:

- Intangible: laws and regulations, instructions, good safety practice, recommendations, procedures and protocols, training programs, work organization, etc.
- Material: physical coding (e.g., special design of medical gas and vacuum connection rings to prevent inappropriate connections of different colors).

**Prevention Barriers**

They are designed to prevent errors and accidents from occurring, such as the surgical checklist, an intangible barrier that breaks down into three stages, or computerized prescribing in a system that provides alerts based on dangerous doses, the patient's clinical and biological condition, drug interactions, etc.

**Operating Theatre Checklist**

Before Anaesthetic Induction:
- Verification of:
  - Patient identity
  - Procedure and surgical site (patient, records)
  - Availability of clinical and paraclinical documentation
  - Knowledge of the installation method, consistent with the site/intervention, not dangerous for the patient
  - Skin preparation of the patient being operated on, documented in the department/operating theatre liaison sheet
  - Equipment/materials required for the operation, with no malfunctions

- Cross-check by the risk team:
  - Allergic
  - Inhalation
  - Intubation difficulties
  - Ventilation
  - Bleeding

Before Surgery:
- Pause time before incision:
  - Ultimate cross-check within the team, in the presence of the surgeon(s), anaesthetist(s)/IADE, IBODE/IDE:
    - Patient identity
    - Planned intervention
    - Surgical site
    - Correct installation
    - Availability of the necessary documents

- Sharing information orally within the team on the elements at risk/critical stages of the intervention (time out) in terms of:
  - Surgical
  - Anaesthetic

- In accordance with current protocols:
  - Administration of antibiotic prophylaxis
  - Preparation of the operating field

After Surgery:
- Break before leaving the operating theatre:
  - Oral confirmation by staff to the team:
    - Of the recorded intervention
    - The correct final count of compresses, needles, instruments, etc.
    - Labelling of samples, operating theatres, etc.
    - If any undesirable events or medical risks have occurred: report/notification

- Prescriptions for immediate post-operative care are made jointly by the surgical and anaesthetic teams.

N.B: IADE: state-qualified nurse anaesthetist; IBODE: state-qualified operating theatre nurse; IDE: state-qualified nurse.

**Recovery Barriers**

The mistake has been made but recovered before it has any consequences. For example, the patient is allergic to penicillin, which is the antibiotic prophylaxis prescribed before surgery, but the nurse reads about it in the medical record and alerts the prescriber, who changes the prescription.

**Mitigation Barriers**

The error has been made and has not been recovered. The aim is to limit the consequences for the patient. For example, a patient suffers cardiac arrest as a result of an error in the route of administration made by a nurse. She notifies the senior doctor as soon as she realizes the error. The medical team is on site and starts cardiac massage while the SOS cardiac arrest team called in immediately arrives. The electric shock restored cardiac function, and the patient was transferred to intensive care for stabilization and monitoring. He was discharged the next day.

**Root Cause Analysis**

The root causes of a medical error should be sought in the overall context surrounding the undesirable event. The analysis methods are structured to avoid oversights. The most commonly used methods are the ALARM method and the Orion¬Æ method. Root cause analysis methods generally include the following six steps for proper application:

1. Data collection: semi-structured interviews with all the people present at the time of the event, files, any other documents needed to understand the events.
2. Reconstructing the chronology of the event.
3. Identifying deviations from recommended practices, without judging against an existing benchmark.
4. Identification of contributing factors: immediate and deep or root causes.

**Typology of Contributing Factors or Root Causes (According to the ALARM Method)**

Factors may be linked to:
- The patient: state of health, seriousness of associated illnesses, communication difficulties (language, conflict with carers, etc.), vulnerability of certain patient populations (the elderly, patients with chronic illnesses, children, adolescents, people with disabilities, the underprivileged, etc.).
- The tasks to be carried out.
- The team: communication within the team and with the patient in the therapeutic relationship, traceability of information in the patient file, supervision of junior staff undergoing training.
- The working environment: physical (premises, equipment, supplies, etc.) or organizational (availability of qualified human resources, work organization, working hours, etc.).
- Organization and management: policies for replacing absent staff (no replacement, temporary staff, travel), continuous training, equipment management, etc.
- The institutional context: national and regional public health policies, adverse event reporting systems, etc.

**Anatomopathological Examination**  
Anatomopathological examination confirms the diagnosis of melanoma and determines the essential histoprognostic criteria:

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

### Overview

- The elderly population is diverse in terms of biological aging and cognitive decline, which may be linked to age or neurodegenerative pathology. Aging alters the perception and expression of pain, especially if there is cognitive impairment. Pain is often underestimated and undertreated, and treatment must be individualized and adapted according to the patient's health status, including comorbidities and chronic treatments.

### Acute Pain

- Certain acute conditions that are typically painful in adults, such as myocardial infarction, visceral pain, ulcers, and fractures, can be ""silent"" in the elderly. They often present late at the emergency department and report their pain later than younger adults, leading to more complications that can be serious or even fatal.

### Chronic Pain

- The prevalence of chronic pain is high, affecting between 40% and 80% of people living at home or in institutions. It has various aetiologies, including osteoarticular, muscular, neuropathic, and iatrogenic causes.

### Pain Management

Pain management is based on four pillars: Spotting, Evaluation, Treatment, and Revaluation.

#### Spotting

- Some types of pain are predictable, such as pain during care or pressure sores, while others are more difficult to anticipate, like paroxysmal attacks of pain. It is important to look for warning signs and have a pain reflex, especially if the behavior is abnormal, such as agitation or screaming. Any elderly person expressing pain or behavior suggestive of pain should be considered in pain, and the precautionary principle should be applied.

#### Evaluation

- The patient should be correctly seated, with an empathetic and patient approach, fostering a climate of trust while considering any cognitive or expressive difficulties. A geriatric assessment, including depression and behavior, is conducted alongside identifying pain components. Self-assessment is done using a simple numerical or verbal scale. If this fails, an observation of behaviors using a hetero-evaluation scale (e.g., Algoplus¬Æ, Doloplus¬Æ, ECPA¬Æ) is used, preferably in a team, and repeated regularly.

#### Treatment

- Aging modifies the pharmacology of drugs, including analgesics. The same analgesics and co-analgesics used by younger adults are used, but adverse effects and contraindications are more numerous due to comorbidities and polymedication. Clinical pharmacists can help screen for drug-related iatrogenia and assist in drug reconciliation. Mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain often coexist in the elderly. Before prescribing analgesics, the patient's health, drug treatment, renal function, weight, nutritional status, cognitive and emotional state, social situation, and compliance must be assessed. Dosage adjustments are recommended, with dosages increased slowly, and renal function monitored. Potential adverse effects and interactions of added analgesics are anticipated and avoided, but pain should not be undertreated for fear of adverse effects. Topical oral and local administration routes are preferred. It is recommended to combine analgesics with non-pharmacological techniques, adapted to the sensory deficits caused by aging.

#### Revaluation

- Always reassess to adapt and prioritize treatments to reduce multi-medication and optimize the benefit-risk balance. An elderly patient who does not complain can still be in pain.",0.75,16.99,False,True,0.8241642117500305,0.6602847178777059,c,False,1,4

**Epidemiology:**

- Parvovirus B19, a DNA virus, belongs to the Parvoviridae family.
- Human-to-human transmission occurs via the respiratory route (saliva, droplets) or transplacentally.
- It is a very frequent infection, generally from childhood to school age, with 40 to 80% of adults being immune.

**Clinical Features:**

- Incubation period is 6 to 18 days.
- Occurs in 2 phases:
  - Pre-eruptive (invasion): Low fever and nonspecific general signs, lasting 48 to 72 hours.
  - Eruption: Appearance of a maculopapular rash starting on the cheeks (very red and infiltrated), then affecting the trunk and limbs with an ""arabesque"" appearance (erythema reticulata), which may persist for up to 3 weeks. The rash may be accompanied by a low-grade fever.

Other eruptive forms include ""socks and gloves"" syndrome, erythema multiforme, or more rarely, livedo or erythema nodosum. Joint involvement such as arthralgia or arthritis may accompany the rash and is more common in adults.

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

Autoimmune bullous diseases are classified into two distinct groups: pemphigoid, characterized by a subepidermal bulla, and pemphigus, characterized by an intraepidermal bulla.

The subepidermal bulla is defined by a cleavage under the epidermis, whereas the intraepidermal bulla is located in the epidermis (supra-basal region for pemphigus vulgaris, subhorned region for superficial pemphigus).

The bulla of pemphigoid is usually taut (except on mucous membranes, where it ruptures rapidly), while the bulla of pemphigus is flaccid and fragile.

The distinction between pemphigoid and pemphigus is based on clinical, histological, direct and indirect immunofluorescence, and serological tests.

- **Clinical Presentation:**
  - Bullous pemphigoid affects individuals over 70, often in poor general condition. It is accompanied by intense pruritus and manifests as eczematous or urticarial lesions covered with tense bullae. Lesions are localized to the roots and flexural surfaces of the limbs; the head, neck, and mucous membranes are spared. Biologically, there is blood hypereosinophilia.
  - Pemphigus vulgaris affects individuals around 45 and manifests as painful erosions of the oral mucosa and other mucous membranes (genital, anal, nasal, conjunctival). Secondarily, there may be cutaneous bullae on non-inflammatory skin and a positive Nikolsky's sign. It may be drug-induced or associated with another autoimmune disease. In superficial pemphigus, there are no mucosal lesions but only squamous-crusty or even keratotic skin lesions.

- **Histological Findings:**
  - In bullous pemphigoid, a subepidermal bulla with an infiltrate of eosinophilic polynuclear cells is observed.
  - In pemphigus vulgaris, an intraepidermal bulla with acantholysis (detachment of keratinocytes) is found.

- **Immunofluorescence:**
  - Direct immunofluorescence shows a linear deposition of IgG and C3 at the dermal-epidermal junction in bullous pemphigoid and a deposition of IgG and C3 on the surface of keratinocytes in pemphigus (intercellular or mesh marking).
  - Indirect immunofluorescence reveals circulating antibodies recognizing the dermo-epidermal junction at high titre in bullous pemphigoid and circulating antibodies recognizing the intercellular substance in pemphigus.

- **ELISA Findings:**
  - These circulating antibodies recognize the following target antigens: BP180 and BP230 proteins in bullous pemphigoid, desmoglein 3 in pemphigus vulgaris, and desmoglein 1 in superficial pemphigus.",1.0,10.941428571428574,False,True,0.7588061690330505,0.8870848814646403,c,False,3,4

**Title:** Main Types of Observational Studies  
**Description:** Know how to define, recognize, and describe: cohort study, exposed/unexposed study, case-control study, cross-sectional study. Be able to link an objective with one or more types of survey.  
**Rubric:** Definition  

Unlike experimental studies, in observational studies, the nature and level of the exposure factors to which the subjects are subjected are not modified by the researcher.

There are three main types of observational survey design, which must be adapted to the study's objective.

== Cohort Survey ==  
Enables a sample of subjects to be followed over time:

- **Binary Judgement Criterion:** Not affected by the health phenomenon studied and records the number of new cases that appear over time.
- **Quantitative Endpoint:** Monitors changes in the endpoint (e.g., viral load, level of depression) known at inclusion.

**Objectives:**

- **Descriptive:** Estimate the frequency of disease occurrence, possibly comparing it with the incidence rate in the general population or other populations, or between periods, possibly standardizing on the distribution of sex and age.
- **Analytical:** Study the relationship between an exposure factor and the health phenomenon by comparing frequency indicators between groups of exposed and unexposed subjects using tests and measures of association.

**Methods of Recruitment:**

- **Cohort Study with a Cross-Sectional Starting Point:** Initial sample formed from the selection or random drawing of subjects at recruitment centers. Aims for representativeness of the target population.
- **Exposed/Unexposed Cohort Studies:** A particular form of cohort where exposed and unexposed subjects are selected separately.

**Follow-up After Inclusion:** Characterized by the follow-up of subjects since their inclusion to collect data:

- Occurrence of the event studied or changes in the level of the endpoint.
- Date of early exit from the study due to death, relocation, or lack of follow-up.

**Retrospective, Prospective, or Mixed Character:**

- **Prospective Cohort:** Inclusions start after the study protocol is finalized.
- **Retrospective Cohort (Historical):** Inclusions start before the study protocol is finalized. The initial sample is reconstituted retrospectively.
- **Mixed Cohort:** Combination of retrospective and prospective inclusion.

== Case-Control Study ==  
Involves the separate selection of two groups:

- **Cases:** Subjects suffering from the event under study.
- **Controls:** Subjects not affected by the event.

**Advantage:** Over-representing rare phenomena in the population. Including several controls per case can increase statistical power.

**Objectives:** Exclusively analytical, studying the relationship between the exposure factor and the phenomenon by comparing the prevalence of exposure in cases and controls using the odds ratio.

**Recruitment of Cases:**

- **Case-Incident:** Recruitment at diagnosis or event occurrence.
- **Prevalent-Case:** Recruitment regardless of how long ago the diagnosis was made, allowing faster recruitment.

**Recruitment of Controls:** Must be from the same population as cases, ideally eligible as cases if they had developed the health phenomenon. Often done in parallel with case recruitment.

**Collection of Exposures:** Always retrospective for both groups, covering the period before the survey starts.

== Cross-Sectional Survey ==  
Used to estimate qualitative indicators (prevalences, distributions) or quantitative indicators (averages, medians, variances) in a targeted population.

**Objectives:**

- **Descriptive:** Estimate indicator levels with a quantifiable margin of error. The only study type that estimates prevalences of a binary health phenomenon at the study time.
- **Analytical:** Study the relationship between the exposure factor and the phenomenon by estimating measures of association. Interpretation is limited due to the difficulty in establishing a chronological relationship.

**Recruitment Procedures:** Must be representative of the target population, independent of health status or exposure level. Random selection or consecutive inclusion are preferred methods.

**Information Collected:** Status of each subject regarding the phenomenon studied and exposure factors at inclusion. Background and history may also be collected, but no data on events after inclusion are gathered.",0.9,16.59,False,True,0.7669196128845215,0.7593971292177836,c,True,5,3

=Calcium Channel Blockers: Understanding the Mechanisms of Action, Indications, Side Effects, Drug Interactions, Monitoring Procedures, and Main Causes of Failure=

These drugs are commonly called ""calcium channel blockers"" or ""calcium antagonists,"" but the more accurate term is ""calcium channel blockers.""

== Drug Classes ==

- Calcium antagonists with a mixed cardiac and vascular effect: verapamil and diltiazem.
- Dihydropyridines with a predominantly vascular effect; INN ""-dipine"": e.g., amlodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine.

== Mechanism of Action ==

Calcium channel blockers bind to cardiac and/or vascular membrane L-type calcium channels. This binding leads to a reduction in the inflow of calcium into the cardiomyocyte (inotropic, dromotropic, and negative chronotropic effect) and/or into the smooth muscle cell (peripheral, coronary, and cerebral vasodilatation).

== Indications ==

- Hypertension, as first-line treatment
- Stable angina
- Verapamil and diltiazem: paroxysmal junctional tachycardias and certain supraventricular rhythm disorders.
- Verapamil: post-infarction if beta-blockers are contraindicated
- Nifedipine: symptomatic treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon
- Nimodipine: prevention of neurological deficits caused by cerebral vasospasm after meningeal hemorrhage.

== Undesirable Effects ==

- **Dihydropyridines and less frequently verapamil and diltiazem:**
  - Flushing, headaches
  - Peripheral edema

- **Specific to verapamil and diltiazem:**
  - Bradycardia, conduction disorders
  - Heart failure

== Drug Interactions ==

- **Dihydropyridines:**
  - Avoid grapefruit juice, which can cause overdose.

- **Verapamil and diltiazem:**
  - Pharmacokinetic interactions: CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, responsible for multiple drug interactions (atorvastatin and simvastatin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, ergot derivatives, dabigatran, etc.).
  - Pharmacodynamic interactions: contraindicated in combination with beta-blockers, bradycardia drugs, antiarrhythmics, etc.

== Contraindications ==

- **Verapamil and diltiazem:**
  - Heart failure
  - Bradycardia, sinus dysfunction, and untethered second- and third-degree atrioventricular blocks

**Title:** Knowing the Aetiologies of Varicose Veins and CVI  
**Description:** Understanding the Main Causes of CVI  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) results from the inability of the venous network to ensure correct drainage of the lower limb. Any phenomenon that reduces this will generate venous stasis, which is the cause of CVI. There are three main causes of venous return failure. The possible aetiologies are included in the CEAP classification of CVI (""E"" for aetiology).

== Primary Venous Insufficiency ==

**Varicose Disease or Essential Varicose Veins or Primary Varicose Veins**  
Varicose veins are defined as veins with pathological walls that become dilated and tortuous, with valvular incontinence. This is the most common aetiology. There are two types of varicose veins:

- Systemic varicose veins, which develop at the expense of the greater and lesser saphenous veins.
- Non-systematic varicose veins, known as non-saphenous varicose veins, which develop at the expense of perforating veins or pelvic veins.

**Primary Deep Valve Insufficiency**  
Primary deep valve insufficiency results from a defect in valvular continence or valvular dysgenesis of the deep veins, leading to deep venous reflux. It is a rare condition.

== Secondary Venous Insufficiency ==

**Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS)**  
The risk is particularly high in cases of iliofemoral thrombosis. It is estimated that 20-50% of deep vein thromboses will become complicated by PTS despite well-managed treatment (5-10% will develop severe PTS).

**Compressive Venous Syndromes**  
Cockett's syndrome is due to compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. It can range from simple compression to thrombosis or complete left iliofemoral occlusion. Other chronic extrinsic venous compressions are mainly due to pelvic tumors. They are usually responsible for iliofemoral thrombosis.

== Functional Venous Insufficiency ==

This term is currently reserved for venous return failure with morphologically normal veins. This situation may be linked to a reduction in walking ability, tibio-tarsal ankylosis, a loss of muscle volume, or an alteration in cardio-respiratory dynamics. It is frequently encountered in the elderly.

== Other Causes of Venous Insufficiency ==

These represent only a very small proportion of the causes of venous insufficiency. These are simple or complex venous malformations. The most common malformative syndrome is Klippel-Tr√©naunay syndrome, which combines venous dysplasia, capillary malformation, and elongation/hypertrophy of the affected limb.

Fragile X syndrome is:

- The leading cause of familial intellectual disability (Psychomotor Developmental Anomaly SD-115)
- The second most common cause of genetic intellectual disability (after trisomy 21)
- The leading genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (Child and Adolescent Behaviour Disorder SD-133)

Prevalence is estimated at around 1/5,000 in men and 1/8,000 in women (2% of intellectual disabilities in boys and 1% in girls).

The estimated frequency of premutations in the general population is 1/250 in women and 1/500 in men.

In the case of small premutations (< 100 CGG), genetic investigations should be continued to look for another cause of the neurodevelopmental disorder. However, it is important to offer genetic counselling to the patient's family, as there is a high risk of genetic instability that could lead to the appearance of a complete mutation in other children (announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327, disability situation SD-345).

The medical management of AOMI aims to slow the progression of atheromatous disease by correcting risk factors, particularly tobacco cessation, and instituting systematic drug treatment including:

- In symptomatic patients, an antiplaquettaire, a statin even in the absence of dyslipidaemia, and an IEC even in the absence of hypertension are instituted.
- In asymptomatic patients, a statin even in the absence of dyslipidaemia and an IEC even in the absence of hypertension. Antiplaquettaire treatment is discussed according to the patient's overall cardiovascular risk.

**In Case of Claudication:**

- Walking training should be introduced after assessment of coronary exercise tolerance, based on a personalised programme including regular assessment. It can be practised by self-training at home or optimised by treatment in a specialised centre with supervised rehabilitation and a structured therapeutic education programme. It allows collaterals to be developed and walking distance to be increased.
- Surgical revascularisation improves perfusion in the affected area. Sometimes, without aiming for complete revascularisation, it aims to treat the most significant lesion. It may be performed using endoluminal techniques (angioplasty with or without a stent) or open surgery (endarterectomy or bypass for proximal lesions).
  - In the event of persistent disabling claudication despite optimal medical management for 6 months and control of atheromatous risk factors.
  - It may be discussed from the outset or at an earlier stage in the case of lesions that pose a threat due to their location or haemodynamic impact.

Regular monitoring ensures:

- Adherence to proposed therapeutic lifestyle modifications, walking rehabilitation, and drug prescriptions.
- Achievement of therapeutic targets:
  - LDL cholesterol below 1.4 mmol/L (0.55 g/L) and 50% reduction from baseline.
  - Blood pressure below 120/70 mmHg if well tolerated. In elderly or frail patients, higher blood pressure levels may be tolerated.
  - Glycaemic control
  - Smoking cessation
- Tolerance of treatment; effectiveness of management
- Patency of revascularisation

**In Case of Symptoms at Rest:**

The immediate therapeutic objective is limb salvage in the event of symptoms at rest.

- Revascularisation is essential whenever possible and must be as complete as possible given the high risk of amputation.
- If ischaemia persists despite revascularisation, amputation becomes necessary.
- Amputation from the outset remains a therapeutic option if revascularisation is not possible or if the local situation is life-threatening, in particular extensive necrosis or infection.
- Complementary medical treatment aims to combat aggravating factors such as pain, infection, and malnutrition. Treatment for OAMI is continued or introduced.

**Title:** Detection of Addictive Behaviors and Associated Risk Factors During Pregnancy

**Rubric:** Diagnosis

Addictive behaviors must be identified during the various interviews carried out during pregnancy. The question of the use of medication, tobacco, alcohol, and illicit products must be asked. It is also important to identify the risk factors and lifestyle aspects that will lead to the discussion of addictive behaviors, to an understanding of how women who use drugs function, and to avoid, on the part of both carers and patients, the negative representations and fears that paralyze human relationships and encounters.

Elements of understanding can be found in:

- The mother's life story
- The history of the parental couple
- Maternal lifestyle
- Maternal health
- Maternal fears

Greater attention is needed to spot certain less visible situations.

In women who are often well integrated into society and belong to high socio-professional backgrounds, addictive behaviors insidiously take hold. This includes 'social' consumption of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, opioid drugs, benzodiazepines, etc., on festive evenings or even professional evenings, and, little by little, to cope with stress, combat fatigue, improve performance at work, etc. When pregnancy occurs, these women, who have never identified themselves as drug addicts and do not frequent specialized services, become aware of their addiction. They find themselves at a loss and experience their pregnancy alone and with guilt.

It is essential to identify them so that multidisciplinary care can be provided, and this is most often the responsibility of perinatal professionals.

**Definitions**

Vulnerability: A historically and culturally situated concept. The concept of vulnerability began to be used in psychological and medical literature (in psychiatry and gerontology) in the early 1970s, and in the 1990s was widely extended to the entire medical, health, social, and scientific field. It was incorporated into the Criminal Code, providing special protection for certain victims based on physical and psychological criteria (such as age, illness, or infirmity), as well as economic and social criteria (such as dependence due to extreme hardship). Today, it is widely used in politics and the media, shaping our relationship with others and the world.

Like the concepts of risk and precariousness, vulnerability has become essential in the humanities and social sciences for understanding people in their social and psychological experiences. In today's high-tech societies, our vulnerability is intensified by the ambivalence between our heightened awareness of risks and the impossibility of controlling them all.

**Two Definitions of Vulnerability**

In the human and social sciences, there are two main definitions of vulnerability:

- **Fundamental or Ontological Vulnerability**: A constituent of human existence, universally shared, referring to our anthropological and biological fragility. It involves human existence affected by illness, loss, and distress.

- **Social Vulnerability**: Dependent on particular historical and social contexts. It concerns groups or individuals considered vulnerable due to few economic resources, precarious employment status, lack of social support, or obstacles to social integration. Care must be taken not to reduce these groups to their vulnerability, as it can have a negative social connotation and be perceived as the responsibility of the individuals themselves. Sociologist Serge Paugam uses the concept of social disqualification to examine the experiences of people living in precarious conditions.

Social vulnerability is also considered dynamically, as the effect of a historical process undermining the wage-earning system and moving towards globalised capitalism. The society of the twentieth century, characterised by a solid wage-earning condition, is crumbling, leading to decollectivisation and re-individualisation. Individuals with limited resources experience downgrading, dependence on social assistance, low self-esteem, and insecurity.

While fundamental and social vulnerability are often dissociated, many authors, including Robert Castel, invite us to consider them together, viewing vulnerability as both a universal condition and a potential that can affect everyone differently due to relational and contextual dimensions.

**The Ethics of Care**

Vulnerability is central to care ethics, which highlight the epistemological, ethical, and political issues involved in using this concept. Care thinking emerged in the United States in the 1970s, with the work of Carol Gilligan and Joan Tronto. It became established in France in the 2000s. Vanessa Nurock argues that translating ""care"" as ""soin"" or ""sollicitude"" is insufficient, as care involves a novel combination of feelings, sensitivity, activity, position, and relationships.

Care is not just an ethical attitude in intimate relationships but also has a public and political dimension. The ethics of care challenge a hierarchy based on male domination that devalues care, reducing it to the care and concern for children and elderly parents provided by women.

Care ethics emphasise understanding people in their singularity and relationships, highlighting dependencies and interdependencies. These relationships must extend to institutions, examining how we care for others through institutions and how we care for these institutions.

The ethics of care remind us that dependence and vulnerability concern everyone, criticising the myth of autonomy. Vulnerability is not a defect or lack of autonomy but the normal condition of living beings, the common ground of our humanity.

**Vulnerability in Medicine**

In medicine, vulnerability is associated with illness, as it alters the person's state, requiring them to cope with medical examinations, diagnosis, treatments, and the injunction to autonomy. Medical practice has traditionally involved caring for individuals made vulnerable by illness, within an asymmetrical doctor-patient relationship, leading to criticism of ""paternalistic"" medicine.

Although medical paternalism is largely a thing of the past, doctors still encounter situations where patients cannot exercise their rights and autonomy. In such cases, decision-making may be delegated to the medical team or relatives, with the aim of restoring the patient's decision-making role if possible.

Vulnerability is not simply an inability to be autonomous. The ethics of care view vulnerability as a relational capacity essential in the care relationship. The carer is also vulnerable, exposed to the patient's suffering, placing the care relationship within a reciprocal and intersubjective framework. The carer's concern is not just about meeting the patient's needs but also about considering the patient as a capable subject, calling on their resources, desires, and willpower to remain active in the face of illness.",1.0,13.063333333333333,False,True,0.8226488828659058,0.6098349491755167,c,False,2,3

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Definitions**

**Algies of Dental Origin**

The most common causes of mouth pain typically occur in the mouth, on a tooth, and can become increasingly severe, persistent, and radiating, depending on the cause. A dental examination is necessary.

- **Dentin Caries:** Brief pain after stimulus to the tooth (cold, hot, sugar, acid).
- **Acute Pulpitis:** Sharp, radiating, homolateral pain, initially provoked and then spontaneous.
- **Purulent Pulpitis:** Pulsating, violent, long-lasting pain radiating throughout the oral cavity.
- **Periodontitis:** Stabbing, sometimes intense pain, aggravated by lying down and heat, with a sensation of a ""long tooth""; edema and gingival inflammation opposite the causal tooth, very painful axial percussion of the tooth.
- **Dental Abscess:** Complication of untreated or poorly treated conditions, sharp, stabbing, sleepless pain with general infectious signs and sometimes spectacular local signs (edema, vestibular filling, reddening of the skin opposite the causal tooth, trismus, cervical adenopathy).
- **Alveolitis:** Occurs 2-3 days after a tooth extraction, violent pain radiating from the tooth.
- **Accidental Evolution of the Mandibular Wisdom Tooth:** Locoregional pain, local inflammatory signs opposite teeth 38 or 48, sometimes trismus.
- **Pain Induced by Orthodontic Treatment:** Generally caused by slightly too rapid movement of the teeth, which ceases as soon as the movement is moderated. Sometimes due to mucosal injury caused by orthodontic equipment (careful examination required).

**Algies of Sinus Origin**

Facial pain opposite the affected sinus, increased by bending forward and pressure on the sinus. Causes include acute and chronic sinusitis.

**Algies of Non-Dental Oral Origin**

Most lesions of the oral mucosa are painful. Diagnosis is generally straightforward in the presence of oral pain, based on examination of the mucosal surface (tongue depressor, good lighting, palpation with gloves).

- **Traumatic Ulceration:** Localized sharp pain. Examination reveals a lesion with regular borders, discreetly erythematous. Little or no induration. Removal of the causative agent leads to healing in a few days. Any lesion persisting for more than a fortnight should be biopsied.
- **Mouth Ulcers:** Very common. Continuous pain, sometimes sleepless, exacerbated by eating certain foods. Examination shows well-rounded ulceration, regular margins, flat fibrinous base, surrounded by a slightly red halo. Palpation reveals a soft base. Sometimes severe pain and inability to eat orally due to large mouth ulcers in immunocompromised patients (hospitalization for parenteral nutrition or SNG).
- **Cancers of the Oral Cavity:** Spontaneous pain which increases with chewing and limits eating. Examination shows ulcerations with raised edges, indurated, bleeding on contact or painful, congestive inflammatory tumor. Biopsy is essential.
- **Infections with Ulceration of the Mucous Membranes:** Single oral ulceration (tuberculosis) or multiple (oral herpes).
- **Lingual Mycoses:** Burning pain (candidiasis).
- **Drug-Induced Toxicidermia:** Erythema multiforme.
- **Radiotherapy-Induced Mucositis:** Diffuse pain throughout the oral cavity, increased by the absence of saliva (makes eating difficult).
- Any general pathology can lead to painful lesions in the oral mucosa.

**Algies of Salivary Cause**

**Facial Pain of Bony Causes**

- **Fractures of the Facial Bones:** Post-traumatic pain due to mobilization of the fracture site (during palpation/pressure examination). Impotence of the mandible if fractured at this level.
- **Osteitis:** Throbbing, fluctuating, non-rhythmic pain.
- **Post-Radiation Osteoradionecrosis or Osteitis:** Painful osteolysis, most often of dental origin, a few years after radiotherapy for a tumor of the face and neck.
- **Bone Tumors:** Benign tumors are painless except in the event of inflammation or superinfection. Malignant tumors may become painful as a result of invasion of the trigeminal branches (symptomatic neuralgia with V2 or V3 dysesthesia).

**Facial Pain of Mandibular Causes: Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Pain**

- **Acute TMJ Pain:**
  - **Acute Arthritis:** Rare, with local inflammatory signs and limited mouth opening.
  - **Fractures:** Post-traumatic, painful limitation of mouth opening by local muscle contracture.
  - **Dislocation**
- **Chronic Secondary TMJ Pain:** Periarticular, laterofacial, preauricular, and retro-orbital pain, with temporal and masseter myalgias radiating readily to the upper and lower molar sectors. Examination shows temporomandibular pain on pressure of the external auditory canal and endobuccal palpation of the masticatory muscles. A pop and a snap when opening the mouth, which is usually bayonet-shaped. Most often due to an anomaly in the dental articulation.",0.3,15.685555555555556,False,True,0.754269540309906,0.6705228090286255,d,False,2,4

**Title:** Know How to Diagnose a Mediastinal Anomaly  
**Description:** Tumor, emphysema, aortic widening, cardiomegaly  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Definitions**  
The mediastinum is the anatomical region of the thorax between the two lungs. It is divided into three compartments, often defined on a profile X-ray:

- **Anterior Mediastinum:** Contains fatty tissue, the thymus, and ganglion chains.
- **Middle Mediastinum:** Contains the heart, ascending thoracic aorta and crossover, pulmonary artery, trachea and main bronchi, phrenic and vagus nerves, and lymph node chains.
- **Posterior Mediastinum:** Contains the descending thoracic aorta, esophagus, splanchnic and sympathetic nerves, paravertebral fat, and lymph node chains.

The segmentation of the mediastinum is illustrated on a profile chest radiograph, with the anterior mediastinum in blue, the middle mediastinum in green, and the posterior mediastinum in yellow.

**Mediastinal Abnormalities**  
Mediastinal abnormalities may correspond to:

- The presence of a tumoral, inflammatory, infectious, or congenital mass in the mediastinum. Examples include mediastinal lymphoma, neurogenic tumor, paraspinal abscess, and bronchogenic cyst.
- An abnormal increase in volume of a mediastinal structure. Examples include aneurysm of the thoracic aorta, dilatation of the pulmonary artery, and cardiomegaly.
- An abnormal presence of an extra-mediastinal structure in the mediastinum. Examples include intra-thoracic thyroid goitre and hiatal hernia.

**Causes of Mediastinal Masses**  
The main causes of mediastinal masses, classified by compartment, are:

- **Anterior Mediastinum:** Adenopathies (including lymphomas), thymic tumors, germ cell tumors, thyroid gland, pleuropericardial cyst.
- **Middle Mediastinum:** Adenopathies (including lymphomas), bronchogenic cysts, vascular dilations.
- **Posterior Mediastinum:** Adenopathies (including lymphomas), neurogenic tumors, esophageal tumors, hiatal hernia.

**Characteristics of Mediastinal Abnormalities on X-ray**  
On a chest X-ray, a mediastinal abnormality is characterized by:

- A clear external boundary convex towards the lung
- Gently sloping into the mediastinum
- Internal limit not visible because indistinguishable from mediastinal elements
- Hydric in tone like the rest of the mediastinum

The mediastinal contours are often distorted. On the right, the superior arch corresponds to the right brachiocephalic venous trunk, the middle arch to the superior vena cava, and the inferior arch to the right atrium and minimally to the inferior vena cava. On the left, the superior arch corresponds to the left subclavian artery, the middle arch to the aortic button and pulmonary artery, and the inferior arch to the left ventricle.

The left pulmonary hilum is always slightly higher than the right. Normal pulmonary hili are never convex.

**Cardiomegaly**  
A frequently encountered mediastinal anomaly is cardiomegaly. Cardiomegaly is defined on a chest X-ray taken in the standing position by a cardiothoracic index greater than 0.5.

**Diagnostic Imaging**  
While chest X-rays can detect mediastinal abnormalities, thoracic CT is the examination of choice for pinpointing the location of the abnormality and characterizing the lesion. Mediastinal MRI may also be indicated in certain special cases.

**Examples of Mediastinal Abnormalities on Imaging**  
Examples of mediastinal abnormalities on chest radiograph, with CT images provided for illustration, include:

- Superior and middle mediastinal enlargement (""chimney"") on chest radiograph and anterior and middle mediastinal mass on chest CT. Example: Hodgkin's disease.
- Convex deformity of the left middle arch on chest X-ray and dilatation of the pulmonary artery on chest CT. Example: Pulmonary artery hypertension.
- Convex deformity of the right hilum and filling of the aortopulmonary window on chest X-ray, with adenomegalia of the right hilum and aortopulmonary window on coronal CT scan. Example: Mediastinal sarcoidosis.
- Rounded opacity with sharp contours in projection of the cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray, with posterior mediastinal mass with partial aero content on chest CT. Example: Hiatal hernia.",1.0,18.19909090909091,False,True,0.6989966034889221,0.6458145976066589,c,False,4,3

The standard treatment for type 1 diabetes is intensified insulin therapy: injection of slow-acting insulin and several injections of rapid-acting insulin each day, or use of an insulin pump. Prescription of insulin therapy, follow-up consultation, and education of a type 1 diabetic patient (SD-280).

Intensified insulin therapy reduces glycated haemoglobin and delays and reduces the severity of micro- and macroangiopathic complications. It does, however, increase the risk of severe hypoglycaemia.

The objectives of treatment are a compromise between ensuring the freest possible life and preventing acute or chronic complications of the disease.

Therapeutic education is necessary to empower patients in the self-management of their disease and must take into account the experiences of patients and their families.

- Spermatic cord torsion should be diagnosed in cases of sudden acute testicular pain in infants and adolescents aged 12 to 18, with hormonal activity peaks. It is rare after age 40.
- Causes irreversible arterial ischemia of the testicle 6 hours after pain onset. It is a surgical emergency.
- Prognosis for testicular function is compromised by ischemia and testicular necrosis, correlated with ischemia duration. Delayed detorsion increases risk to gonadal functions.
- Torsion of the spermatic cord is a therapeutic emergency regardless of ischemia duration.
- Surgery should be performed without delay if there is doubt. Testicular Doppler ultrasound can be misleading and should not delay treatment.
- External detorsion has limited use, aiming to relieve pain and reduce ischemia duration without delaying surgery. Successful pain regression does not eliminate the need for urgent surgical exploration.

**Refusal of Treatment by Healthcare Professionals**

Refusal of treatment by a healthcare professional involves the practitioner's freedom of conscience, continuity of care, and equal access to care. A doctor may refuse to provide care under a ""conscience clause,"" which allows refusal of a medical act that is legally authorized but contrary to the doctor's personal, professional, or ethical convictions. This is permissible only under conditions strictly defined by law.

Doctors may refuse treatment for professional or personal reasons, such as disagreement with a patient, aggressive behavior, or incompetence regarding a specific illness. However, they must inform the patient immediately and pass on any useful information to the practitioner designated by the patient.

A specific ""conscience clause,"" introduced in 1975 by the Veil law on voluntary termination of pregnancy, allows a doctor or medical auxiliary to refuse to carry out or assist in a voluntary or medical termination of pregnancy, or sterilization.

In certain cases, refusal of treatment is compulsory: the medical act must pursue a therapeutic necessity, and the benefits must outweigh the risks. Care must not exceed the practitioner's competence. No one may be discriminated against in access to prevention or care (Code of Medical Ethics, art. 7).

The Criminal Code prohibits discrimination against people for any reason, including health or disability. Healthcare professionals refusing care based on origin, sex, family situation, health, disability, morals, sexual orientation, age, political opinions, trade union activities, ethnic group, nation, race, religion, or detention status face disciplinary, criminal, or civil penalties.

Cases of discrimination often involve patients receiving universal health cover (CMU) or state medical aid (AME).

**Patient Refusal of Care**

A patient's refusal to accept treatment highlights the tension between the ""principle of beneficence,"" which requires patient benefit, and the ""principle of autonomy,"" which requires respecting the patient's wishes.

The law of 4 March 2002 on patients' rights and healthcare quality seeks a compromise between beneficence and autonomy. It places the person's consent at the heart of any care act. Patients must be informed of their health status, proposed care, and consequences of refusal. They have the right to consent to or refuse investigations and care, even if refusal poses health or life risks. Refusal must be repeated and recorded in the medical record.

When a person cannot express their wishes, no intervention may occur without consulting a trusted support person, family, or close relative, except in emergencies. The consent of minors or adults under guardianship must be sought, even if the guardian's agreement is necessary. If refusing treatment could seriously affect the health of a minor or person under guardianship, the doctor will provide necessary treatment.

The law promotes a model of joint decision-making between doctor and patient. The doctor provides an opinion on the condition and therapeutic plan, and the patient makes a choice based on medical proposals. However, the doctor must convince the patient to accept essential care if life is in danger. In life-threatening emergencies, if the doctor cannot convince the patient of treatment necessity, they cannot be accused of providing treatment against the patient's will. Case law prioritizes life preservation over patient wishes in emergencies, such as refusal of blood transfusion by Jehovah's Witnesses.

Refusal of care is expressed when individuals at the end of life, or not, experiencing extreme suffering, refuse treatment and life support and request assistance in dying.

The Clayes-L√©onetti Act of 2016 addresses this issue by placing the patient at the center of decision-making. It prohibits unreasonable obstinacy and obliges doctors to respect patients' wishes to refuse treatment after informing them of the consequences. It affirms the patient's right to deep and continuous sedation until death when the prognosis is vital in the short term. Advance directives are binding on doctors, and in their absence, the patient's wishes, as expressed by a trusted person or relatives, must be considered.

Stopping treatment does not mean stopping care. Care responds to the fundamental needs of the vulnerable person, who is alive, feeling, suffering, thinking, and involved in social relationships.

Ethically, refusal of treatment is not refusal of care. Respecting refusal of treatment is part of care and requires understanding diverse situations and reasons for refusal, such as religious beliefs, cultural values, social conditions, and life concepts. Respecting patient autonomy involves listening, understanding, and relating to help achieve a truly autonomous will and find an individualized solution. The care relationship maintains the person in the exchange, sharing, and community of human beings.

**Description:** Aside from intensive training: respiratory and orthopedic symptoms.

**Rubric:** Etiologies

As in adults, sport in children presents macrotraumatic risks (fractures, wounds, etc.) which are not specific to sport. However, intensive sport can also cause microtrauma, or ""overuse"" pathologies, linked to the repetition of sporting activities. This is the case for adults (tendinopathies, fatigue fractures, etc.) and children.

The main pathologies in children appear during growth peaks, at a time when the conjugation cartilages are particularly active. This pain around the growth plate is known as osteochondrosis, and is due to disturbances in ossification and is linked to the mechanical factors generated by sporting movements: tendon traction on the apophyseal cores, impact on the growth plate, shearing of the epiphyseal growth plates. The pubertal growth spurt, during which body mass and biomechanical leverage increase, is particularly at risk.

The two most frequent locations are:

- The posterior apophysis of the calcaneus (heel): Sever's disease. Appears most frequently around the age of 9-10.

- The apophyseal nucleus of the anterior tibial tuberosity (knee): Osgood-Schlatter disease. A common pathology in team sports (football, etc.), tennis, gymnastics, etc., most frequently appearing around the age of 13 in boys and 11 in girls.

These pathologies are diagnosed clinically, with the examination revealing mechanical pain localized in the growth plate. X-rays may be used to complete the assessment.

Treatment consists of a period of sports rest. Only the most severe cases require immobilization and offloading.

**Title:** Understanding the mechanisms of maternal-fetal transmission of frequently implicated viruses

**Description:** HSV, HBV, HIV, VZV

**Definitions**

**HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus)**

Severe neonatal herpes is rare, with 20-30 cases per year, but more than half of affected children die or suffer serious neurological sequelae. The main route of infection (80%) is through the infected genital tract during childbirth. In exceptional cases, infection may occur during the mother's pregnancy or postnatally from a maternal herpes infection or within the family.

The risk of contamination during childbirth is approximately:

- 50% if the primary infection occurred in the month preceding labor
- 2 to 5% if the recurrence occurred in the week preceding labor
- 1/1,000 in cases of a history of genital herpes without visible lesions
- 1/10,000 in the absence of a history of genital herpes

The risk is minimal in the absence of a known history of herpes but requires further investigation. However, as this is the most common case, the majority of neonatal herpes cases are observed in this situation. This is because:

- 3 to 5% of women have a known history of recurrent genital herpes
- 20% of women are seropositive for the HSV2 virus and may excrete the virus intermittently; genital herpes is commonplace but often goes unrecognized

**HBV (Hepatitis B Virus)**

One percent of pregnant women are affected. Vertical transmission is mainly intra- and post-natal. Its frequency depends on viral replication, assessed by measuring the maternal plasma viral load:

- 90% in the presence of viral DNA (PCR test); if the viral load is very high (> 200,000 copies/ml), a hepatologist's opinion is recommended
- 10 to 20% if the viral DNA test is negative but in the absence of anti-HBe antibodies; close to 0% in the presence of anti-HBe antibodies

In the event of a high viral load, antiviral treatment should be initiated. Transmission does not depend on the mode of delivery (vaginal delivery or caesarean section). Infected newborns can develop hepatitis, with a 90% risk of becoming chronic, and a high risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Sero-vaccination of the child at birth is recommended, and the neonatologist should be informed.

**HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)**

Mother-to-child transmission, which is 15-20% in the absence of prenatal treatment, is now around <1% with current antiretroviral (ARV) triple therapy. The virus is not teratogenic.

Vertical transmission of HIV can occur in three stages:

- Pre-partum (infection during pregnancy), where HIV passes from the mother to the fetus via the placenta
- Intrapartum (infection during childbirth)
- Post-partum (via breastfeeding); 2/3 of contaminated children are infected during childbirth

Transmission can be influenced by several factors:

- Maternal: transmission is increased before childbirth in highly immunocompromised women with clinical signs (AIDS), a high viral load, and low CD4 lymphocyte levels
- Obstetric: transmission is increased in cases of premature rupture of the membranes, placental abruption, premature delivery, and intra-uterine infection (chorioamnionitis)
- Breastfeeding: a major factor in postnatal contamination in developing countries
- Associated maternal infections: genital infections, STIs, and especially HCV-HIV-HSV co-infection

**VZV (Varicella-Zoster Virus)**

Transmission of chickenpox during pregnancy exposes the fetus to risks such as:

- Embryofetopathy: the risk is estimated at 2-2.5% for contaminations mainly before 20 days' gestation, leading to amniotic bridges, skin lesions following a dermatome, anomalies of the extremities, intrauterine growth retardation, muscular hypotrophies, limb hypoplasia, microphthalmia, cataract, chorioretinitis, microcephaly, polymicrogyria, hydrocephaly, cortical atrophy
- Shingles in the first year of life: when chickenpox is contracted between 21 and 36 weeks' gestation (and more than 3 weeks before childbirth)
- Varicella neonatorum: for a birth occurring during maternal varicella in the days surrounding the birth. Vesicles and vesicular rash (cutaneous-mucosal) may occur

In the case of maternal varicella, there is a risk of potentially serious pulmonary varicella, which warrants monitoring and awareness-raising by the attending physician (fever, pulmonary auscultation, etc.).

**Title:** Human Factors: Understanding the Concept of Human Error (Typology and Contributing Factors)

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Definition

Human beings are fallible, and it is in their nature to make mistakes. Acknowledging that we can make mistakes is a prerequisite for adopting error-prevention behavior. Recognizing that we have made a mistake is an opportunity to learn and progress. This is true for individuals and organizations. When an organization implements systems for identifying, analyzing, and preventing errors, it is referred to as a ""learning organization.""

**Individual Human Factors**

Lack of knowledge, skills, and experience can lead to mistakes. It's important to remember that you can't know everything. Memory is limited, and you need to be able to check or ask for help.

Stress, lack of time, fatigue, and illness are circumstances that reduce an individual's performance.

Certain linguistic or cultural factors can interfere with the proper understanding of a situation. Finally, there are also factors linked to the patient, whose attitude or behavior influences the risk of error.

**Collective Human Factors**

Providing care, especially in hospitals, is a team effort. Poor team organization, lack of communication, and even conflict can hamper cooperation and increase the risk of errors.

An effective team starts with the awareness that it is a team with identified leadership. Everyone's role is clearly defined. Communication is organized with briefings before the action and debriefings afterward.",1.0,14.798947368421054,False,True,0.7203811407089233,0.7375791668891907,c,False,5,2

**Title:** Identifying Varicose Veins and CVI  
**Description:** Knowing the main clinical signs of chronic venous insufficiency  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

== Clinical Expression of Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) ==  
The symptoms of CVI are frequent, varied, and not very specific. The intensity of symptoms and physical signs vary according to the degree of venous stasis. They increase when circumstances aggravate venous stasis and decrease when it improves. Neglected, CVI can cause trophic disorders such as skin ulcers (SD-092). The symptoms are integrated into the CEAP classification of the IVC (""C"" for clinical).

== Functional Signs ==  

- Pain or heaviness in the lower limbs: This is the most frequent symptom of CVI. It occurs in the calves or legs and may be limited to simple discomfort or tiredness.
- Cramping
- Painful vein pathway or phlebalgia: Exacerbated pain in the pathway of a vein.
- Intermittent venous claudication related to chronic obstruction of a major venous confluence. This is a painful heaviness that does not prevent the patient from continuing to walk, does not subside rapidly when walking is stopped, and subsides progressively when the patient is in a decubitus position.

=== Evidence in Favour of a Venous Origin ===  
Increased symptoms in the following situations:  

- During the day
- After prolonged standing or sitting
- Heat (underfloor heating) or exposure to the sun
- During pregnancy, when taking oestroprogestins, or during the premenstrual period

Improvement of symptoms in the following situations:  

- Cold
- Elevation of the lower limbs
- Decubitus
- Physical exercise
- Elastic venous compression (socks, stockings, bands)

=== Differential Diagnoses ===  
Other symptoms, such as impatience, tingling, and skin redness, may be present but must be differentiated from two other less well-known diagnoses:

- Nocturnal impatience (imperious need to move the legs), which may be part of the ""restless legs syndrome"": The patient describes a sensation of numbness of the limb in a position of immobility, rapidly intolerable, forcing them to move.
- Burning and redness of the foot after a few hours' sleep, waking the patient and forcing them to seek contact with the cold, corresponding to erythermalgia (SD-015).

== Cutaneous Signs ==  
Trophic cutaneous signs linked to the development of venous insufficiency and varicose veins include:

- Varicosities or telangiectasias: Dilations of small-caliber veins (< 3 mm). When located on the ankle or plantar arch, they are known as corona phlebectatica and are a warning sign of the onset of a venous ulcer in the long term.
- Varicose veins
- Localized or diffuse oedema (SD-054) of the foot: It is white, soft, takes on a cup-like appearance, with a clear increase at night, without redistribution to other areas.
- Pigmented dermatitis: Caused by the passage of red blood cells into the dermis, releasing their iron pigments. Ochre dermatitis is irreversible and usually begins on the inside and lower side of the leg.
- Eczema of the lower third of the leg: A frequent complication of chronic venous stasis. The lesions are erythemato-vesicular or scaly in the pathological venous territory.
- Milian's white atrophy: Small porcelain-white areas, mainly located on the malleolus, surrounded by ochre dermatitis or telangiectasia. It reflects a rarefaction of capillaries within fibrous tissue, indicating genuine cutaneous ischaemia, heralding the onset of a venous ulcer.
- Stasis dermo-hypodermatitis (lipodermatosclerosis): Localized to the lower third of the leg, initially inflammatory with skin redness and pain, then progressing in flare-ups. These lesions are associated with extravasation of polymorphonuclear cells. Progressive evolution leads to sheathing fibrosis inducing a rigid gaiter (""sclerotic hypodermitis""). Ankylosis of the ankle further impairs venous return. The diagnosis of erysipelas is an important differential diagnosis of inflammatory stasis hypodermatitis.
- Lymphatic stasis: The consequence of advanced CVI, which alters the lymphatic network. It leads to permanent infiltrated oedema and thickened, cardboard-like skin. Lymphatic stasis is often aggravated by recurrent local superinfections.
- Venous ulcer (SD-092).

== CEAP Classification of CVI (""C"" for Clinical) ==  
The CEAP classification of CVI is as follows:

- 0: No visible or palpable signs
- 1: Telangiectasias or reticular veins
- 2: Varicose veins
- 3: Edema
- 4: Trophic disorders: ochre dermatitis, eczema, hypodermatitis

**Description:** Prematurity, Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IUGR), Risk Situations Linked to Maternal Pathologies, Neonatal Bacterial Infections, Respiratory Distress

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

The obstetric and pediatric team's knowledge of the maternal history, the course of the pregnancy, and the term of birth enables them to identify, before birth, groups of children at risk of presenting difficulties in adapting to life outside the womb and/or neonatal or longer-term complications.

Only the main risk factors and neonatal complications are listed in this chapter; refer to item 30 for a detailed description of the pathophysiology and preventive measures.

**Prematurity**

**Definition:**  
Prematurity is defined as birth before 37 weeks' amenorrhea (SA) and, from 22 SA, of a child weighing at least 500g.

**Main Risk Factors:**

- Maternal Background:
  - Single, low socio-economic level, smoking, alcohol consumption, drug addiction, stress, anxiety, depression, prolonged standing, inconsistent follow-up
  - History of premature delivery and late miscarriage, uterine malformation, fibroids, in utero exposure to Distilbene¬Æ, short interval between last two pregnancies, conisation, cervico-isthmic incompetence, bacterial vaginosis, IVF
  - Chronic maternal pathologies (heart disease, nephropathy, etc.), neoplasia, etc.
- Multiple pregnancies
- Complications of Pregnancy: hypertensive pathologies including pre-eclampsia, retroplacental hematoma, metrorrhagia (Genital bleeding during pregnancy), intrauterine growth retardation, uterine contractions, premature rupture of membranes (Loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman), placental anomalies (placenta previa, etc.), hydramnios, amniochorionic infection.

**Possible Complications in Children:**

- Deaths
- Hypothermia
- Neonatal bacterial infection
- Anemia
- Metabolic: hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, icterus
- Neurological: intraventricular hemorrhages, periventricular leukomalacia
- Respiratory: hyaline membrane disease, apnea, bronchopulmonary dysplasia
- Hemodynamics: persistence of the ductus arteriosus
- Digestive: enteropathy/ulcerative necrotizing enterocolitis, feeding difficulties
- Ophthalmological: retinopathy of prematurity

Longer term: neurodevelopment disorders (motor, cognitive), sensory anomalies, etc.

**Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IUGR)**

**Definitions:**  
Small for Gestational Age (SGA) is defined as an isolated weight (estimated in utero weight or birth weight) below the 10th percentile. Severe SGA corresponds to a SGA below the 3rd percentile.

IUGR (Fetal Growth Restriction - FGR) most often corresponds to a SGA associated with arguments in favor of a pathological growth defect: stoppage or inflection of growth longitudinally (at least 2 measurements 3 weeks apart).

**Main Risk Factors:**

- Maternal Background / Obstetrical History: age < 20 years or > 35 years, malnutrition, low socio-economic level, smoking, alcoholism, drug addiction, uterine malformations, multiple or large fibroids, history of pregnancy complicated by IUGR, low weight gain during pregnancy, placental hemangioma, velamentous cord insertion
- Fetal Pathologies: chromosomal anomaly, malformative syndrome, fetal infection (especially CMV). These IUGRs are early (onset in the 2nd trimester) and severe (BP < 3rd percentile), and often associated with morphological anomalies or hydramnios
- Vascular Pathologies: preeclampsia (Arterial hypertension and/or Hypertension during pregnancy and Proteinuria), chronic maternal pathologies: chronic arterial hypertension, nephropathy, lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, diabetes with vascular complications. IUGR of vascular origin is most often late (onset in the 3rd trimester), but can be early in severe forms. These IUGRs tend to recur in subsequent pregnancies.

**Possible Complications in Children:**

- Perinatal asphyxia
- Hypothermia, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia
- Polycythemia secondary to chronic fetal hypoxia
- In the case of associated prematurity, increased mortality and risk of respiratory and digestive complications

Longer term:

- Neurodevelopmental abnormalities
- Growth retardation
- Metabolic syndrome in adults

**Neonatal Bacterial Infections (NBI)**

Refer to the 2017 good practice recommendations: Management of the newborn at risk of early bacterial neonatal infection (‚â• 34 SA).

**NBI Risk Factors:**

1. Maternal colonization with SGB
2. History of neonatal GBS infection
3. Maternal fever > 38.0¬∞C intrapartum or within 2 hours of delivery
4. Membrane rupture > 12h
5. Spontaneous and unexplained prematurity < 37 SA
6. Antibiotic prophylaxis or inadequate per-partum antibiotic therapy

**Identify Newborns Presenting Symptoms of NBI:**  
General signs: fever (temperature ‚â• 38.0¬∞C) or hypothermia (temperature < 36.0¬∞C)  
Respiratory signs: respiratory distress, tachypnea (respiratory rate > 60/min), apnea  
Hemodynamic signs: tachycardia (> 160 bpm) or bradycardia (< 80 bpm), signs of shock  
Neurological signs: somnolence, irritability, hypotonia, convulsions  
Digestive signs: refusal to drink, vomiting

**Complications Possible in Children:** Variable depending on the bacteria responsible for NBI and the severity of the infection (septic shock, meningitis)

**Respiratory Distress**

**Main Risk Factors:**

- Prematurity
- Risk factors for early neonatal bacterial infection
- Diabetes prior to pregnancy, gestational diabetes
- Caesarean section before labor
- Meconium amniotic fluid
- Perinatal anoxo-ischaemia

**Clinical Diagnosis:** Presence of one or more of the following symptoms:

- Polypnea: FR > 60/min
- Signs of respiratory struggle: flapping of the wings of the nose, thoraco-abdominal rocking, intercostal draught, xyphoid funnel, expiratory whimpering
- Cyanosis and/or low oxygen saturation

**Signs of Seriousness:**

- Intensity of respiratory distress: Silverman score
- Pauses in breathing
- Associated hemodynamic disorders

**Complications Possible in Children:** Mainly related to the cause of respiratory distress

**Maternal Pathologies: Diabetes During Pregnancy**

**Complications in Children Specific to Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Prior to Pregnancy:**

- Congenital malformations (especially of the central nervous system, heart, and skeleton)

**Complications in Children Common to All Types of Diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, Gestational):**

- Fetal death in utero
- Prematurity
- Macrosomia and obstetric complications (shoulder dystocia, brachial plexus injury, fracture, perinatal asphyxia)
- Metabolic: hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, polycythemia, jaundice
- Respiratory distress (in particular hyaline membrane disease)
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy possible

Longer term:

- Metabolic risks: obesity, glucose intolerance, etc.

**Maternal Pathologies: Infections**

Refer to item 27 Prevention of fetal risks: infection, drugs, toxic substances, irradiation.

**Main Infections at Risk for the Fetus and/or the Newborn:**

- Bacterial: syphilis, listeriosis, bacteria responsible for NBI (mainly Streptococcus B, E. Coli)
- Viral: genital herpes, measles, rubella, chickenpox, cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus B19, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV
- Parasitic: Toxoplasmosis

**Maternal Pathologies: Medical Treatments**

Refer to item 27 (Prevention of fetal risks: infection, drugs, toxic substances, irradiation).

Drug treatments should be taken into account during the pre-conception interview, during pregnancy, and/or during breastfeeding because of the potential teratogenic risks, fetal risks, or neonatal risks.

These risks are specific to each drug and, depending on the case, may be contraindicated / not recommended / possible during all or part of pregnancy.

It can be discussed:

- Adjusting dosage
- Specific treatment in the event of fetal exposure
- Monitoring or care of the newborn baby

**Maternal Addictions (Tobacco, Alcohol, Drugs)**

Refer to item 27 (Prevention of fetal risks: infection, drugs, toxic substances, irradiation) for screening and management of maternal addictions.

**Possible Complications for the Child of Maternal Smoking:**

- During pregnancy: teratogenicity, spontaneous miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight/intrauterine growth retardation
- In newborns, infants, and children: unexpected infant death syndrome, lower respiratory infections (bronchiolitis), ENT infections (acute otitis media)
- In the longer term: overweight/obesity, more frequent and earlier onset of smoking in adolescents whose parents are smokers

**Possible Complications for the Child of Alcohol Consumption by the Mother:**  
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) / Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD)

- FAS: documented especially in cases of heavy consumption. Varying degrees of association with intrauterine growth retardation, facial dysmorphia, malformations, mental retardation, and behavioral disorders.
- Acute consumption (of the ""binge-drinking"" type) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive problems in children.

**Possible Complications for the Child of Maternal Drug Addiction:** Variable depending on the product and the quantities consumed. Frequent poly-drug use.

- Opiates: mainly neonatal withdrawal syndrome
- Cocaine: fetal death in utero, spontaneous miscarriage, placenta previa, premature rupture of membranes, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation
- Cannabis: spontaneous miscarriage, placenta previa, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation

It is important to detect such use, to offer the woman treatment and addictological follow-up with a view to weaning her off the drug or at least reducing her consumption, to monitor the newborn baby in the light of the risks mentioned above, and to assess the social and family situation and provide treatment on a case-by-case basis.

**Maternal Psychiatric Disorders**

Refer to item 69 - Pregnancy and post-partum psychological disorders for psychological pathologies specific to pregnancy.

Whatever the mother's psychological pathology, the child's care is based on:

- Specific neonatal monitoring according to maternal treatments taken during pregnancy
- Assessment of the family situation (state of health of both parents, family environment)
- Case-by-case care after the birth (support measures, parenting support, proposals for day-care facilities or mother-baby hospitalization, drafting of a report of concern/reporting to the cellule de recueil des informations pr√©occupantes and possible separation of mother and child in the event of possible danger to the child).",0.6666666666666666,11.784285714285716,False,True,0.7616392970085144,0.6671252648035685,b,False,5,4

The risk of respiratory complications and mortality is increased in pregnant women in the event of influenza.

**Definitions**

**Primary Prevention**

Flu vaccination is the best way for pregnant women to protect themselves. Only inactivated influenza vaccines can be used in pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy. Transplacental passage of maternal influenza antibodies confers protection on newborns and infants who cannot be vaccinated before the age of 6 months.

Hygiene measures (wearing masks, using hydroalcoholic solutions, limiting visits) to reduce transmission have proved effective. It is important to limit contact with other people, especially those at risk.

**Hygiene Measures**

- Cover your mouth whenever you cough (mask).
- Cover your nose every time you sneeze.
- Blow your nose into single-use tissues disposed of in a lidded bin, then wash your hands with SHA.
- Spit only into a single-use paper handkerchief disposed of in a lidded bin, then use SHA.
- Wash your hands after each of these actions and regularly throughout the day.

**Secondary Prevention**

**Situation**  
- Influenza in pregnant women: Yes, if signs of severity.  
  - Treatment: Oseltamivir (Tamiflu¬Æ) 75 mg: 2/d for 5 days ¬± paracetamol ¬± amoxicillin 3 g/d for 7 days.  
  - Hospitalization: No, unless signs of severity.  
  - Additional droplet precautions: 7 days (reference LG/ULI/051).  

- Contact < 48 hours with a pregnant woman with a possible case of influenza in the family: No in the absence of symptoms.  
  - Prophylactic treatment with Oseltamivir (Tamiflu¬Æ) 75 mg: 1/d for 10 days.  
  - Hospitalization: No.  

- A close relative of a pregnant woman has had contact with a possible case of influenza: No.  
  - Treatment: No.  
  - Hospitalization: No.  

**Clinical Signs of a Possible Case of Influenza (Epidemic Period):**  
- General signs: fever > 38¬∞C or aches and pains or asthenia.  
- Respiratory signs: cough or dyspnoea.  

**Surroundings:** People living in the same dwelling or in close contact with it (< 1 m).

**Signs of Seriousness:**  
- Impairment of higher functions (confusion, impaired alertness, disorientation).  
- Respiratory rate > 30/min.  
- PAS < 90 mmHg.  
- HR > 120/min.

A nasal swab is taken for virological testing if there are any signs of seriousness or co-morbidities.

Curative antiviral treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu¬Æ) is started as soon as possible, and at the latest within 48 hours of the first signs, regardless of the trimester of pregnancy and whether or not there are any serious risk factors, without waiting for the results of the biological diagnosis.

Treatment is stopped if the virological test is negative (RT-PCR).

**Title:** Systemic Approach: Learning About the Positive Error Culture Approach

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Definition

This information is sent to a risk management unit and to the healthcare risk management coordinator, a compulsory function in every health establishment.

The third major class of error detection involves active systems based on the analysis of files or electronic traces. Retrospective analysis of files is a time-consuming and labor-intensive system unless a computer search using a predefined program searching for keywords is organized.

Serious adverse events are analyzed either with:

- A neutral external viewpoint, provided by the risk management unit.
- A positive error culture is part of the patient safety culture. It is based on not blaming the person who made the mistake. The natural tendency is to consider that the person responsible is the last in the chain of people involved in a care process. However, most of the time, the causes are multiple and often latent, undetectable at first glance.

A non-blaming attitude, which must be shared by the head of the clinical department and hospital management, encourages the reporting of errors, their analysis, and the implementation of improvement measures to prevent the recurrence of such errors. The opposite attitude means that errors are hidden. Failure to analyze them in depth creates second victims. A second victim can be defined as: ""a carer who is involved in and traumatized by an unforeseen and unfavorable event for a patient and/or a medical error for which he or she often feels personally responsible, leading to a feeling of failure and calling into question his or her clinical experience and fundamental skills."" The consequences can be serious, even leading to suicide when the carer, the last link in the chain, is personally implicated.

Drawing up and complying with operating rules is one of the conditions for confidence in the healthcare risk management system. These rules can be set out in a charter, which specifies that reporting an error will not be penalized. Important elements of this charter include the following details:

- Objectivity is the rule. Reporting is based on facts that are not interpreted.
- Anonymity and confidentiality will be respected in the analysis that follows the reporting of the error or adverse event.
- To be effective, reporting must be exhaustive, identifying all the risks associated with hospital activity and preventing them from recurring.

Serious adverse events occurring in hospitals are usually identified using passive systems based on:

- Voluntary reporting by doctors and other healthcare professionals, even though the 2009 ""Hospital, Patient, Health and Territory"" law makes it compulsory.
- The desire of patients, their families, or close friends to explain the problems they have encountered or to obtain compensation for the harm they feel they have suffered.

This information is sent to a risk management unit and to the healthcare risk management coordinator, a compulsory function in every health establishment.

The third major class of error detection involves active systems based on the analysis of files or electronic traces. Retrospective analysis of files is a time-consuming and labor-intensive system unless a computer search using a predefined program searching for keywords is organized.

Serious adverse events are analyzed either with:

- A neutral external viewpoint, provided by the risk management unit.
- A point of view from within the hospital department, which must also be as neutral as possible, on the occasion of morbidity and mortality reviews (MMR).",0.75,10.723333333333333,False,True,0.7535181045532227,0.6530247728029887,b,False,5,3

**Definitions**

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are the two main entities of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE).

**Deep Vein Thrombosis**

This is a partial or total venous obstruction caused by an endoluminal thrombus, which may be located throughout the venous tree, most often in the lower limbs.

In the lower limbs, DVT is:

- Proximal (popliteal and suprapopliteal)
- Distal, i.e., sub-popliteal, involving the collecting trunks (posterior tibial, anterior tibial, fibular) or muscle veins (soleus, gastrocnemius)

**Pulmonary Embolism**

PE occurs when a venous thrombus migrates into the pulmonary arteries.

**High-Risk PE (Severe PE)**

- PE associated with haemodynamic failure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg or drop in SBP ‚â• 40 mmHg for more than 15 minutes), in the absence of another cause such as sepsis, arrhythmia, or hypovolaemia.

## Epidemiology of Cutaneous Carcinomas

The incidence of cutaneous carcinomas is increasing. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer and the most common of all cancers, with an incidence of around 150 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year in France. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is rarer, with 30 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year. SCC is 2 to 3 times more common in men than in women.

The risk of developing carcinoma is higher in individuals with a light phototype (I and II), and the incidence increases with age. Sun exposure is the main factor promoting carcinomas, including both chronic and cumulative exposure (EC and BCC) and intense, intermittent sun exposure (BCC). Immunosuppression (e.g., organ transplants, chronic hematological diseases, HIV infection) is also a risk factor for skin carcinomas. Carcinomas primarily develop in areas exposed to light, particularly the face and back of the hands.

The phototype corresponds to an individual's ability to interact with the sun. Six phototypes are defined according to eye color, hair color, the presence of ephelides (freckles), sensitivity to sunburn, and the ability to tan (Fitzpatrick phototype classification).

## Incidence of Melanoma

The incidence of melanoma varies worldwide depending on the phototype of the population and UV exposure (latitude). In France, it is 15 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year and has been rising for several decades.

### Main Risk Factors for Developing Melanoma:

- Light phototype (blond or redhead, ephelides, light eyes)
- High number of nevi (>50)
- High number of atypical nevi (>10)
- Personal history of melanoma
- Family history of melanoma (10% of melanomas occur in a family context)
- Sunburn in childhood or sudden, intense exposure to the sun

In the majority of cases (80%), melanoma appears de novo and not on a pre-existing nevus or precursor.

### Phototype and Reaction to the Sun:

- **I**: Tanning = 0, Sunburn = systematic, Very fair complexion, Light eyes, Blonde or red hair, Numerous ephelides
- **II**: Tanning = +/- (with difficulty), Sunburn = often, Very fair complexion, Blonde or chestnut hair, UV-induced ephelides
- **III**: Tanning = gradual, Sunburn = sometimes, Light complexion, Brown eyes, Blonde or chestnut hair
- **IV**: Tanning = easy, Sunburn = little, Matt complexion, Brown or chestnut hair, Dark eyes
- **V**: Tanning = very easy, Sunburn = exceptional, Dark skin, Dark hair, Dark eyes
- **VI**: Tan = constant, Sunburn = absent, Dark skin, Dark brown eyes",0.25,7.004705882352944,False,True,0.773158073425293,0.6789366404215494,c,True,5,4

Psychosocial rehabilitation covers interventions that enable people to guarantee or improve access to social and civic life. Various social measures exist to facilitate access to housing, work, financial aid, and social life.

**Housing**

Depending on the patient's level of autonomy and the availability of existing aids, they may be able to live independently in their own home (or even with their family) without needing any assistance. Housing assistance can take the form of:

- Therapeutic or community flats
- Social support services (SAVS) or medical-social support services for disabled adults (SAMSAH)
- Home visits and/or household help
- Collective accommodation establishments (foyers de vie, foyers d'accueil sp√©cialis√©s, foyers d'accueil m√©dicalis√©) when independent housing is not possible

2. **Evaluation:**
   - Maternal impact
   - Fetal repercussions: heart sounds / FHR
   - Characterization of the hemorrhage (See ""Genital bleeding during pregnancy (SD-111)"") +/- any accompanying signs:
     - Permanent uterine pain, loss of amniotic fluid
     - Palpation of the uterus (soft or contracted), uterine height, abnormal presentation (transverse)
     - Speculum examination to rule out a cervical cause
     - Urine dipstick to check for proteinuria

3. **Cardiotocographic Recording (RCF) and Tocometry:**
   - Obstetric ultrasound (fetal vitality, position of placenta, HRP rarely visible but informative, EPF, amniotic fluid). Caution: ultrasound should not delay treatment in suspected HRP cases.

4. **Biological Work-up:**
   - CBC, PT, APTT, more complete hemostasis work-up depending on the extent of the bleeding and the diagnosis.

In the event of any abnormality, a cardiologist should be consulted as a matter of course.

Cardiological monitoring is carried out once a year, starting in the first year.

== Paraclinical Follow-up ==  
Radiological follow-up is not systematic. Chest X-rays are generally indicated in cases of abnormal clinical examination (signs of overload, increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette).

ECG monitoring is carried out by the cardiologist and at least once a year by the attending physician.

Peanut is the food most frequently implicated in severe anaphylactic food allergy and responsible for death.

- Prevalence in the general population: 1%
- Allergy generally persistent throughout the patient's life
- Rarely associated with an allergy to other legumes
- Frequently associated with an allergy to nuts (walnuts, pistachios, cashews, hazelnuts)

The diagnosis of allergy to peanuts or nuts is based on:

- History (clinical history compatible with an immediate reaction)
- Food category survey (consumption of peanuts and/or nuts)
- Skin tests (pricks) with standardized extracts or, more often, with the native food. A negative test generally rules out an allergy

**Title:** Knowing the Different Types of Valve Prostheses  
**Description:** Mechanical, Surgical, and Percutaneous Bioprostheses  

== Definitions ==

=== Mechanical Prosthesis ===  
Mechanical prostheses are made from titanium and carbon. Historically, the first prostheses consisted of a ball that moved via the blood flow inside a cage (Starr¬Æ prosthesis), followed by tilting monodisc valves (Bjork-Shiley¬Æ). They currently have a double-wing design that moves on a central axis (Saint-Jude Medical¬Æ, Carbomedics¬Æ).

- The fins open during the ejection phase and close during diastole.
- The ring is covered with Dacron‚Ñ¢ or Teflon‚Ñ¢ to anchor the prosthesis to the biological structure.
- They have excellent durability but require long-term curative anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of the prosthesis. The recommended anticoagulants are anti-vitamin K.
- Due to anticoagulation and the risk of bleeding, implantation is recommended in subjects under 60 years of age in the aortic position and under 65 years of age in the mitral position (Grade IIa / Level C).

The Saint Jude mechanical prosthesis is a notable example.

=== Biological Stents ===  
Biological stents are most often made from bovine pericardium (Carpentier-Edwards Perimount¬Æ, Carpentier-Edwards MagnaEase¬Æ, Medtronic Avalus¬Æ) mounted on a metal frame with a Dacron‚Ñ¢ or Teflon‚Ñ¢ collar. There are also bio-prostheses without a metal frame, such as Freedom Solo - Sorin¬Æ.

- Genuine porcine xenografts, such as the Medtronic¬Æ Hancok II, are also used. Homografts from human donors may be used more rarely.
- Their durability is less than that of mechanical prostheses, with the development of stenosis or regurgitation on the valve prosthesis in the event of degeneration. Durability is estimated at 10 to 15 years, depending on the position of the prosthesis, the type of prosthesis, and the patient.
- Their main advantage is biocompatibility. They do not require long-term anticoagulation if the patient is in sinus rhythm. In the mitral or tricuspid position, anticoagulation with VKA for the first three months following implantation (endothelialization time) is sufficient. In the aortic position, platelet anti-aggregation for the first three months following implantation (duration of endothelialization) is sufficient.
- Implantation is recommended in subjects over 60 years of age in the aortic position and over 65 years of age in the mitral position.

The biological prosthesis is a notable example.

=== Percutaneous Stents ===  
Percutaneous stents are most often made of porcine pericardium (Medtronic CorValve¬Æ) or bovine pericardium (Edwards Sapiens 3¬Æ) mounted on a metal stent deployed in the native aortic valve.

- They are currently recommended for patients with a high to intermediate operative risk (Grade I / Level B).
- The situation is evolving for patients aged over 65 with a low risk of surgery, for whom validation by learned societies is expected in the near future.

**Description:** Schedule of attacks, treatment of attacks, initiation of background treatment, non-medicinal treatments.  
**Rubric:** Management  

## 1. Treatment of the Migraine Attack

- **Molecules of Proven Efficacy:** Non-specific treatments include paracetamol, aspirin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), while specific treatments involve triptans. Paracetamol is effective for mild to moderate attacks. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and ketoprofen are authorized for migraine treatment, with naproxen, diclofenac, and indometacin also effective. Triptans, specific anti-migraine drugs, are serotonin 5HT1B/1D receptor agonists and are contraindicated in patients with a history of vascular disease. The dosage is one unit at the start of an attack, repeatable if necessary (maximum 2 per day).

- **Metoclopramide:** Relieves digestive problems in cases of nausea/vomiting.

- **Avoid Opiates:** Due to the risk of drug abuse, addiction, and increased digestive problems. Avoid combined analgesics (e.g., caffeine) as they increase the risk of drug abuse.

**Recommended Treatments for Migraine Attacks:**

- **Aspirin and Anti-inflammatory Drugs:**
  - Aspirin 1000 mg
  - Acetylsalicylic acid 900 mg + metoclopramide 10 mg (Migpriv¬Æ)
  - Ibuprofen 400 mg
  - Ketoprofen 75-150 mg (max 200 mg/day)

  Undesirable effects include digestive disorders and haemorrhage. Main contraindications are peptic ulcer disease, pregnancy > 24 weeks, and metoclopramide use in children under 12 or those with a history of neuroleptic dyskinesia.

- **Triptans (Maximum 2 units/day):**
  - Almotriptan (12.5 mg)
  - Eletriptan (20 or 40 mg)
  - Frovatriptan (2.5 mg)
  - Naratriptan (2.5 mg)
  - Rizatriptan (5 or 10 mg; orodispersible 10 mg)
  - Sumatriptan (50 mg, nasal spray 20 and 10 mg, SC injection)
  - Zolmitriptan (2.5 mg tablet; orodispersible tablet)

  Undesirable effects include nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, heaviness, pain or pressure in the chest, neck or limbs, palpitations, and tachycardia. Main contraindications include coronary artery disease, ischaemic arterial disease, uncontrolled hypertension, stroke, or TIA.

- **Prescription and Advice:** Advise taking medication early, within one hour of the onset of a mild to moderate headache, for no more than 8 days a month to prevent drug abuse. If paracetamol fails, prescribe a triptan and an NSAID on the same prescription, depending on the drugs already tried and the patient's preferences.

  - **Mild Crisis:** Take the NSAID, then the triptan if relief is insufficient after 1 hour.
  - **Moderate or Severe Crisis:** Take the triptan, then the NSAID if relief is insufficient after 1 hour.
  - **Seizure with Aura:** Take the NSAID as soon as the aura starts and the triptan as soon as the headache starts.

  Prescribe a combination of paracetamol and metoclopramide to patients with contraindications to or intolerance of NSAIDs, aspirin, and triptans. Prescribe metoclopramide (oral, rectal, or injectable) for digestive disorders.

- **Follow-up and Optimization of Crisis Treatment:** After at least 3 crises.

## 2. Background Treatment of Migraine

- **Traditional Oral Treatments:** Proven efficacy in episodic migraine includes amitriptyline, flunarizine, metoprolol, pizotifen, propranolol, topiramate, and sodium valproate. Only topiramate has proven efficacy in the prevention of chronic migraine.

- **Antibodies Targeting the CGRP Pathway:** Three anti-CGRP antibodies injected subcutaneously have marketing authorization in France for the prophylaxis of migraine with at least 8 migraine days per month and failure of at least 2 prior treatments. Prescribed by a neurologist, these treatments were not yet reimbursed in 2021.

- **Botulinum Toxin:** Effective in chronic migraine but not episodic migraine. Approved after failure of at least two treatments, as an alternative to anti-CGRP antibodies. Administered in hospital only.

- **Indication for Background Treatment:** Determined based on patient preferences, diary, criteria for severe and chronic migraine, and impact assessed using the HIT-6 and HAD scales. Recommended for patients with frequent and/or disabling attacks.

  - Using seizure medication 8 days or more per month for > 3 months
  - Severe migraine according to French definition criteria
  - Chronic migraine according to ICHD-3 criteria
  - HIT-6 score of 60 or more
  - Disabling migraine attacks despite optimized crisis treatment

- **Objectives of Background Treatment:** Reduce monthly headache days by 50% in episodic migraine and 30% in chronic migraine. Efficacy assessed during the 3rd month of treatment. Failure may be due to ineffectiveness and/or intolerance.

- **Prescription of the First Background Treatment:** Start at a low dose and gradually increase to reach the optimal daily dose, considering side effects. Compliance is vital; encourage once-daily dosing if possible.

  - **Episodic Migraine:** Propranolol or metoprolol as first-line treatment.
  - **Chronic Migraine:** Topiramate as first-line treatment; specialist advice recommended.
  - **Chronic Migraine with Drug-induced Headache:** Prescribe a first-line background treatment and advise weaning off over-used medication on an outpatient basis. Prescribe another seizure treatment to manage rebound headache and residual seizures.

- **Assessment and Monitoring of Background Treatment:** Use a seizure diary and HIT-6 scale to assess effectiveness, which must be taken regularly for 3 months before evaluation. If effective, continue for 6 to 18 months. If this fails, try a new treatment based on the patient's condition, co-morbidity, and severity of the migraine.

## 3. Management of Migraine During Pregnancy

- **Reassure:** Migraine is not associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, and pregnancy often leads to remission of attacks.

- **Inform:** Treatments follow the recommendations of the Teratogen Reference Centre (CRAT).

- **Crisis Treatments:**
  - **Paracetamol:** First-line treatment.
  - **Triptans:** If paracetamol fails, sumatriptan may be used regardless of the term. If sumatriptan fails, rizatriptan and zolmitriptan are authorized.
  - **NSAIDs:** Formally contraindicated from the 24th week of pregnancy due to the risk of non-closure of the ductus arteriosus; very occasional use during the first two trimesters if necessary.

- **Background Treatments:**
  - **Non-drug Background Treatment:** First-line treatment.
  - **Background Drug Treatment:** Discussed on a case-by-case basis, based on a beta-blocker (propranolol, metoprolol) or amitriptyline.",0.8,13.673333333333336,False,True,0.7457268238067627,0.5706030130386353,a,True,4,4

**Definitions**  
- Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two main causes of familial breast and ovarian cancer, classically known as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). The mode of transmission is autosomal recessive.
- HBOC accounts for around 20% of familial breast cancers, but less than 5% of all breast cancers. It is important to look for a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and, if necessary, to draw up a family tree.
- The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes code for proteins that play major roles in DNA repair and act as tumor suppressors. If these proteins are defective, DNA double-strand breaks are not repaired and contribute to carcinogenesis.
- A patient with a BRCA1/2 mutation should undergo either specific annual surveillance, including breast MRI, or prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. Prophylactic bilateral adnexectomy is systematically recommended (between the ages of 40 and 45).

**Additional Genetic Predispositions**  
- Several cases of cancer in the same person or in the family may point to another genetic predisposition syndrome: PALB2 mutation, Li Fraumeni syndrome (TP53 gene coding for the p53 protein).",0.6363636363636364,14.040000000000003,False,True,0.818311333656311,0.7065373857816061,b,False,5,4

**Prevalence:** Ratio between the number of people affected by a disease in a population, at a given time, and the population as a whole. For example, 150,000 people were living with HIV in France in 2015 (a country with a population of 65 million), corresponding to a prevalence of 2.3/1000 inhabitants.

**Incidence:** Ratio between the number of new cases of a disease in a population, during a given period, and the total population monitored during the period. Example: the number of new cases of tuberculosis in 2012 in France was 4,975 per 65 million inhabitants, corresponding to an annual incidence of 7.6 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

**Attack Rate:** Ratio between the number of new cases of infection during a given period and the total number of uninfected contacts at the start of the period. In epidemic periods, it is used to characterize the transmissibility of the phenomenon over time and/or within different risk groups. For example, whooping cough is a highly contagious disease, and in family epidemics, attack rates of 90% have been observed in non-vaccinated people.

**Basic Reproduction Number (R<sub>0</sub>):** R<sub>0</sub> is the expected average number of new cases of a communicable disease directly generated by a contagious person in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection (without immunity). Example: an R<sub>0</sub> > 1 for COVID-19 indicates that the number of secondary cases is increasing. For influenza, R<sub>0</sub> ‚âà 2, for measles, R<sub>0</sub> ‚âà 16.

**Mortality:** Ratio between the number of deaths in a given period (generally one year) and the total population (generally reported per 100,000 people).

**Lethality:** Ratio between the number of deaths in a given period and the population affected by the condition in question. Example: over the last 10 years, there have been 50 to 60 deaths each year linked to invasive meningococcal infections in France, for a number of cases ‚âà 500/year, giving a mortality rate of 0.1/100,000 (overall population) and a case-fatality rate of 10-12% (among cases).",1.0,10.154545454545456,False,True,0.7146366238594055,0.8794475992520651,b,False,2,5

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

In the majority of cases, Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is asymptomatic. Most often, AAA is discovered incidentally during a clinical examination or by an imaging test such as ultrasound, abdominal computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or even a plain abdominal X-ray showing calcifications in the aneurysm sac. 

The diagnosis may be made in a patient presenting with abdominal or lumbar pain. If the AAA is known to be ruptured, the patient should be referred to a vascular surgery center as soon as possible. Abdominal CT imaging should be carried out urgently. If the AAA is not known, the diagnosis is made on the imaging performed to explore the pain, and the patient is referred to the vascular surgery center as a secondary emergency.

The diagnosis may not be made until the rupture stage, which is a life-threatening emergency. Rupture of an AAA is associated with abdominal or lumbar pain and hemorrhagic shock. When the patient's hemodynamic status allows it, an abdominal CT scan is performed. The patient must be transferred urgently to a vascular surgery center. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis and pinpoints the location of the AAA in relation to the renal arteries prior to emergency transfer to the operating theatre. The overall mortality rate for ruptured AAA is over 80%.

Other revealing clinical presentations are rare:

- Acute arterial occlusion of the lower limb by migration of a fibrino-cruoric embolus from the intra-aneurysmal thrombus.
- Cholesterol crystal embolisms resulting in blue toe syndrome.
- Lower back pain or cruralgia due to vertebral erosion by the shell of the AAA.
- Compression of neighboring organs (ilio-caval venous axes, ureters, digestive tract).

**Interrogatory**

The interrogatory process enables:

- Confirming the diagnosis of constipation and its chronic nature.
- Identifying contributing factors (e.g., sedentary lifestyle, low-fiber diet, medication).
- Detecting symptoms suggesting a secondary cause.
- Understanding the mechanism of constipation: transit or distal (dyschezia).
- Identifying warning signs of colorectal cancer or anal canal cancer (e.g., rectal discharge, change in general condition, recent unexplained change in bowel movements).
- Assessing the impact on quality of life.

Note: It is important to be aware of the notion of ""false diarrhea in constipated patients."" In some patients with distal constipation and the presence of feces in the rectal ampulla (fecal impaction), the breakdown of these feces in the rectum can lead to ""false diarrhea,"" most often reported by the patient as episodes of sudden diarrhea following several days of constipation, with frequent repetition of this ""cycle.""

**Clinical Examination**

Examination of the abdomen may reveal tenderness in the left iliac fossa, opposite the left colon and sigmoid, where fecal matter is stored. The presence of fecal matter can be perceived. Abdominal meteorism may also be observed. The examination looks for signs of a secondary cause. A proctological examination is essential in cases of constipation.

- Examination of the anal margin to look for local lesions (e.g., hemorrhoids, fissures).
- The rectal examination ensures there are no anal or rectal lesions. It can also be used to check for the presence of abnormal matter in the rectal ampulla (fecal impaction), to assess anal sphincter tone, and to look for a rectocele.
- The ""dynamic"" perineal examination consists of examining the patient during pushing. It can reveal a problem with the contraction of the external anal sphincter (most often a lack of relaxation or paradoxical contraction during pushing) and reveal anatomical problems such as perineal descent.",1.0,12.775000000000002,False,True,0.7886077165603638,0.6150380373001099,b,False,4,3

**Description:** None  

Complications associated with MAP are very rare.

**Complications associated with ovarian stimulation:**

- **Allergic risk:** Linked to taking medication; this is an exceptional risk.
- **Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome:** Main risk with variable severity. It is linked to an excessive ovarian response to stimulation, causing pelvic pain and bloating. This can lead to ascites or pleural effusion, with varying degrees of weight gain. Severe forms can be life-threatening, requiring intensive care. The main complication is the risk of arterial or venous thromboembolism, with phlebitis or pulmonary embolism suspected in the presence of chest pain or dyspnoea following puncture. Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) should be instituted in cases of proven ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. If pregnancy occurs during oocyte puncture, this thromboprophylaxis is usually maintained during the first trimester.
- **Adnexal torsion:** An exceptional risk linked to increased ovarian volume during stimulation, suspected with sudden, acute, lateral pelvic pain and pelvic defense. This is a surgical emergency.

**Complications associated with ovarian puncture:**

- **Risks associated with anaesthesia:** Common to all types of anaesthesia, whether local, sedation, or general.
- **Risks associated with ovarian puncture:** Extremely rare, including haemoperitoneum, pelvic infections (such as tubo-ovarian abscesses), and intestinal or urinary tract lesions.

**Complications related to the evolution of the pregnancy obtained:**

- The complications of pregnancy onset by MAP are similar to those of spontaneous pregnancies, including the risk of spontaneous miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Monitoring is identical to that of a natural pregnancy.
- **Risk of gravid venous thromboembolism:** Slightly greater when pregnancy occurs immediately after IVF-c or ICSI compared to spontaneous pregnancies or those after IUI.
- **Multiple pregnancies:** Slightly more frequent, depending on the number of embryos transferred (1 or 2) and the multi-follicular response to stimulation in the case of IUI. The risk of prematurity, caesarean section, low birth weight, and perinatal death is increased compared to a single pregnancy.

**Long-term complications of MAP:**

- **Transmission of a possible genetic abnormality:** Risks inherent in the male or female responsible for infertility.
- **Potential excess risk of certain congenital malformations:** Includes musculoskeletal, cardiac, urogenital, etc., and even cancer in the child in the case of IVF-c or ICSI techniques. These complications remain very rare. The question of whether this risk is linked to MAP procedures or intrinsic biological factors associated with the couple's infertility remains unresolved.

**Toxoplasmosis**  
Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease transmitted by drinking water.

**Taeniasis**  
Taeniasis is a cestodosis, cosmopolitan for ""Taenia saginata"" and tropical for ""Taenia solium."" These flatworms release rings containing eggs in patients' feces. Humans become infected by ingesting eggs (fecal-oral transmission) or larvae contained in undercooked or uncooked meat from intermediate hosts (beef for ""T. saginata"" and pork for ""T. solium""). Ingestion of T. solium eggs leads to cysticercosis, which involves the migration of cysticerci into tissues, with the neurological form being serious. Ingestion of larvae leads to adult tapeworms in the digestive tract.

**Trichinellosis**  
Trichinellosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis, and humans are accidental hosts. Infection occurs by eating raw or undercooked meat contaminated with encysted larvae. Once ingested, the larvae travel to the striated muscles. Clinical symptoms typically include febrile polymyositis and facial edema. The course can be serious, even fatal, in the early phase of larval dissemination.

**Anisakidosis**  
Anisakiasis is a zoonosis of the cold seas. Humans are accidental hosts, contracting the disease by ingesting raw, marinated, or undercooked fish infested with larvae. Symptoms are digestive, with gastralgia, nausea, and vomiting soon after the infested meal.

**Implementation of Protective Measures**

The applicant for a protective measure may be:

- The adult concerned
- Their spouse (husband, partner, etc.), a relative, or a person with whom the adult has a ""close and stable relationship"" (e.g., close friend)
- The person already exercising a legal protection measure in respect of the adult concerned (his/her guardian or curator)
- The public prosecutor, on his or her own initiative or at the request of a third party (who may be the attending physician or hospital doctor, or a social service)

The application must be submitted or sent to the clerk's office of the guardianship judge in the place of habitual residence of the person to be protected. The application is made using a form that is easily accessible on Service-public.fr.

**Medical Certificate Requirement**

Any request to the guardianship judge to open a protection measure must be accompanied by a medical certificate describing any impairment of the person's faculties and the foreseeable evolution, specifying the consequences of this impairment on the need for assistance or representation. The certificate must be drawn up by a doctor chosen from a list provided by the public prosecutor. Recently, the doctor drawing up the certificate has been able to request the opinion of the person's GP.

**Investigation of the Request**

The guardianship judge decides whether an adult should benefit from a protective measure. The judge will hold a hearing with the person to be protected, who may be assisted by a lawyer or accompanied, subject to the judge's agreement, by any person of his or her choice. The hearing may also be attended by the protected person's GP. The judge will automatically hear the person who filed the application for protection.

**Appointment of Curator or Guardian**

The judge appoints one or more tutors or curators. The tutor or curator is chosen first and foremost from among the relatives of the person to be protected. If this is not possible, the judge will appoint a professional, known as a legal representative for the protection of adults. Both guardianship and curatorship can be divided between a guardian (or curator) responsible for the protection of the person (e.g., in the event of marriage) and a guardian (curator) responsible for the management of assets (e.g., to make tax returns).

**Types of Curatorship**

There are three types of guardianship (simple, strengthened, and adjusted), which restrict to a greater or lesser extent the acts that the person to be protected can carry out, to meet the needs of the person to be protected as closely as possible.

**Family Authorization and Future Protection Mandate**

Family authorization allows a close relative (parent, child, grandparent, brother, sister, spouse, cohabitee, PACS partner) to represent a person. This authorization is given by the judge when the person is unable to express his or her wishes on a day-to-day basis or to perform or understand acts of daily life. It may be general or limited to certain acts. Entitlement enables the person representing the person to act on their behalf. The empowered person carries out his or her duties free of charge.

The future protection mandate allows any adult to designate in advance one or more persons (called a mandatary) to represent him or her on the day when he or she is no longer able to manage his or her interests.

**Termination of Protective Measures**

A protective measure is terminated either by the death of the protected person or by a court decision to terminate the measure, noting that the causes that gave rise to the measure no longer exist. The person concerned is released if their state of health improves. The judge may decide to terminate the protection ex officio, and the persons who may apply for termination are the same as those who may apply for protection. As with the application for protection, the judge's decision is based on a detailed, up-to-date medical certificate, which may be issued by the attending physician or another physician, and after hearing the person concerned and their guardian or curator. The improvement or deterioration of the protected adult's situation always makes it possible to modify the protection regime, in the sense of a reduction, a reinforcement (curatorship can be transformed into guardianship), or a change in its mode of exercise.

**Title:** Know How to Diagnose Bladder Instability  
**Description:** Recognize the Clinical Signs  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

- Bladder instability or overactive bladder corresponds to a dysfunction of the detrusor, which has abnormal contractions during the bladder filling phase. It is a frequent cause of daytime and/or nocturnal urine leakage. Children also report pollakiuria and urgenturia. In the case of bladder hyperactivity, there is an uninhibited contraction of the detrusor, which the child tries to control by sphincter contraction, resulting in restraint maneuvers (squatting, pinching the penis, crossing the legs, restlessness, standing on tiptoe, etc.).

**Voiding Disorders: Main Symptoms to Look For**

- Urinary incontinence is an uncontrollable loss of urine, which may be intermittent (daytime and/or nocturnal) or permanent. Permanent incontinence is continuous leakage without real micturition. It forms part of the differential diagnosis of micturition disorders and is found in malformations of the urinary tract (e.g., ectopic abruption of the urinary tract).

- Nocturnal enuresis is an intermittent incontinence exclusively during sleep (night or nap) in a child of at least 5 years of age. Enuresis is considered primary if the child has never had a period of continence during sleep of at least six months. If enuresis reappears after 6 months of voiding control, it is considered secondary. Primary enuresis is said to be isolated or mono-symptomatic if there are no other symptoms, particularly daytime symptoms (e.g., urgenturia, pollakiuria, dysuria), affecting the lower urinary tract.

- Pollakiuria is an abnormal frequency of urination, more than 7 times a day, in a child over the age of 5.

- Urgenturia: sudden, unexpected, and immediate need to urinate.

- Dysuria: abdominal thrust during micturition to initiate or maintain bladder emptying (regardless of the child's age).

- Fractional urination (considered physiological up to the age of 3, if not accompanied by abdominal thrust).

- Atmospheric pollution (adjuvant role/non-specific inflammation, similar to an adjuvant in a vaccine).

- Decline in microbial biodiversity: The hygienist theory observes an epidemiological relationship between the decline in infectious contacts and the increase in allergic and autoimmune diseases. The current theory suggests that the decline in biodiversity (role of the microbiota) is responsible.

- As a result, the incidence of atopy is lower:

**Rubric:** Taking charge

**Definitions:**

Emergency medical structures include the Samu-Centre 15, the mobile emergency and resuscitation services (SMUR), and the emergency services or emergency structures (SU).

**Samu-Centre 15:**

The Samu-Centre 15 is a hospital service whose mission is to respond to emergency situations:

- Provides a permanent medical listening service, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
- Determines and triggers the most appropriate response to the call in the shortest possible time.
- Ensures the availability of public or private hospital facilities appropriate to the patient's condition.
- If necessary, organizes the patient's transport and hospital reception.

In addition, the Samu:

- Participates in drawing up emergency plans and dealing with exceptional health situations.
- Contributes to the initial and ongoing training of healthcare professionals within the emergency care teaching centers (CESU).

The Samu has had a call reception and regulation center (CRRA) with a single national call number since 1978, ""15"", to provide permanent medical assistance. This is known as the Samu-Centre 15.

**Emergency Call Management:**

The call is initially taken by a medical regulation assistant (ARM) responsible for identifying the location of the distress, the caller, and the nature of the call. The call is then handled by a medical regulator (MR) who, while questioning the caller and, if possible, the patient himself, will determine the need for care and commit the necessary resources. This is ""act I"" of medical regulation, a telemedicine act recognized by the regulations and the professional orders. The commitment of resources can be made during the dialogue with the caller, as the medical questioning does not delay the intervention of a team, which is activated while the discussion continues. The emergency medical technician also has an advisory role, advising a witness or the patient on the actions to be taken before the arrival of first aid and/or medical resources. This assistance with actions over the telephone, in which MRAs and emergency medical technicians are trained, is particularly important in the event of a cardiac arrest. The rest of the intervention (""act II"" of medical regulation) is carried out by the MRAs and the RSMs to organize the follow-up to the call and, if necessary, the transport and admission of the patient to a care facility. At this stage, the RSO will be able to advise the teams on site and, above all, direct the patient to the right care.

**Link to Item 17:** Telemedicine, telehealth, and telehealth services.

**Les Services Mobiles d'Urgence et de R√©animation (SMUR):**

The mission of the SMUR, triggered by the Samu-Centre 15, is to take charge, on the spot, outside the hospital, of medical distress and provide emergency care before and during the transport of the patient to the appropriate establishment, designated by the Samu. SMURs may specialize in transporting children (SMUR P√©diatriques).

**Structures des Urgences (SU):**

A hospital service, the SU is responsible for dealing with unscheduled admissions to a public or private health establishment, 24 hours a day, every day of the year, of any unselected person presenting in an emergency situation, including psychiatric emergencies. Emergency Departments are an essential point of entry into the healthcare system. Reception is formalized around the reception organizing nurse (IOA). The ED is generally organized into care pathways, often with specific premises and staff. The life-saving emergency room deals with serious patients. This is a standard feature of an ED, as is a pediatric care unit. There is usually also a short rapid care pathway and a long pathway for patients requiring several additional examinations and hospitalization.",0.75,8.756666666666668,False,True,0.5826589465141296,0.6030954917271932,b,False,5,2

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are frequently associated with atherosclerosis, affecting coronary arteries, carotid arteries, arteries of the lower limbs, and renal and digestive arteries. The existence of familial forms suggests a genetic component in some cases. Vascular prostheses can be complicated by false anastomotic aneurysms.

In rare cases, AAAs may be due to:

- Infectious aneurysm
- Aneurysmal evolution of an aortic dissection
- Hereditary connective tissue dystrophies (e.g., Marfan's disease, vascular Ehlers-Danlos disease, Loeys-Dietz syndrome)
- Inflammatory aortitis (e.g., Takayasu's disease, Horton's disease, and Beh√ßet's disease)

AAA must be detected by ultrasound of the abdominal aorta, often discovered as an abdominal anomaly on medical imaging. This screening is recommended for patients at risk, who include:

- All arteriopaths
- Men aged 60 to 85
- Women aged 60 to 85 who are hypertensive or smokers

**Title:** Understanding the Mechanisms of Hyponatremia  
**Description:** Notion of Hypoosmolality and Cellular Hyperhydration  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

Water accounts for 60% of body weight:  
- 40% in the intracellular sector  
- 20% in the extracellular sector, divided into the interstitial sector (15%) and vascular sector (plasma water 5%)  

Osmolarity is expressed in mOsm/L of plasma.  
Osmolality is expressed in mOsm/kg of water.  

**Estimation of Plasma Osmolality:**  
Posm = [Na+ √ó 2] + Blood glucose (mmol/L) = 285 mOsm/kg of water. In this formula, which estimates effective osmolality (tonicity), urea is not taken into account. Because it passes freely through cell membranes, it increases osmolality without causing water movement.  

At steady state, osmolality is identical between the extracellular and intracellular compartments and is approximately 285 mOsm/kg H2O.  

**Estimation of Urinary Osmolality:**  
Uosm = [Na+ + K+] x 2 + urea (mmol/L)  

A disorder of intracellular hydration is the consequence of a non-zero water balance (positive in intracellular hyperhydration [ICH] and negative in intracellular dehydration [IDH]), and is necessarily accompanied by a change in osmolality (hypoosmolality in ICH and hyperosmolality in ICD) and therefore in natraemia, which is the main determinant of osmolality (hyponatremia in ICH and hypernatremia in ICD). It may be isolated or accompanied by a disorder of extracellular hydration.  

The kidney's capacity to excrete free water is important. It depends on the capacity to suppress hypothalamic-pituitary secretion of ADH and the maximum dilution capacity of the kidney. Under normal conditions, the kidney can lower urinary osmolality to a minimum of 60 mOsm/kg of H2O. Pure water cannot be eliminated on its own, so a minimum supply of osmoles in the urine is required (in practice 60 mOsm/kg). This can lead to a positive water balance and hypo-osmolality (and therefore hyponatremia):  

- When the maximum physiological water excretion capacity is exceeded, for example, in the case of potomania:

**Title:** Knowing How to Prevent Antierythrocytic Alloimmunization During Pregnancy

**Description:** Know the risk situations and prevention methods

Anti-D (Rh1) alloimmunization can only be prevented by medication. In RhD-negative patients whose fetus is Rh-positive (fetal RhD genotyping on maternal blood) or presumed to be Rh-positive (RhD-positive or unknown spouse), this is based on the injection of specific (anti-D) immunoglobulins (Rhophylac¬Æ).

The patient may become alloimmunized during pregnancy in the event of fetomaternal hemorrhage (passage of ""incompatible"" fetal red blood cells into the maternal circulation). The circumstances at risk are as follows:

- Postmenstrual bleeding
- Spontaneous miscarriage
- Voluntary termination of pregnancy
- Ectopic pregnancy
- Ovarian samples (amniocentesis, trophoblast biopsy, fetal blood sampling)
- Abdominal trauma
- External control version
- Childbirth

Prevention is targeted at situations at risk of fetomaternal hemorrhage (listed above) and must be carried out within 72 hours. From the 2nd trimester onwards, the dose to be injected is calculated using a test to quantify fetomaternal hemorrhage (Kleihauer test, which looks for fetal red blood cells in maternal blood).

In the presence of ""silent"" fetomaternal hemorrhage, it is currently recommended that a systematic injection of 300 Œºg of anti-D Ig should be given at the beginning of the 3rd trimester of pregnancy (systematic prevention at 28 days' gestation); after the injection of anti-D, the IAT will become transiently positive.

An IAT must be carried out before any immunoglobulin injection (negative IAT less than one week old) to check that the patient is not already immune.

== Main Psychotherapeutic Trends ==  
There are many different types of psychotherapy. Some of the main trends include:

- **Supportive Psychotherapy:** Widely used and involves adapting the processes of the helping relationship, such as empathic listening and a supportive framework, to psychotherapy.

- **Cognitive Behavioural Therapies (CBT):** Comprises three waves (behavioural, cognitive, ""emotional""). It originates from the work of Ivan Pavlov on conditioning and Aaron Beck on cognitivism. It postulates that patients' symptoms stem from inappropriate learned behaviour, dysfunctional cognition, and/or difficulties in emotional regulation. CBT aims to identify these behaviours, thoughts, and emotions and to find alternative adaptive strategies.

- **Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy:** Includes both analytically inspired psychotherapy and traditional psychoanalysis, stemming from the work of Sigmund Freud. It postulates that patients' problems are based on unresolved unconscious conflicts from childhood.

- **Family/Systemic Therapies:** Consider the family or couple as a dynamic system with continuous interaction among members. The patient's symptoms (""designated patient"", ""symptom carrier"") are included in this systemic dynamic, which needs rebalancing by re-establishing more functional communication and/or interrelationships.

- **Therapeutic Education:** Aims to help patients acquire or maintain the skills they need to manage their lives as well as possible with a chronic disease. It includes organized activities designed to make patients aware of and informed about their illness and care.

- **Cognitive Remediation:** An approach based on neurology, neuropsychology, and rehabilitation, enabling patients to improve their cognitive functioning and thus their quality of life.",1.0,25.745882352941184,False,True,0.7231119275093079,0.6854871312777201,d,False,5,4

**Rubric:** Management  

Since the development of medical techniques, the bodily signs of illness are no longer observed only by the eye of the caregiver but also by a range of technical devices: thermometers, stethoscopes, medical imaging, biological analyses, etc. These tools have redefined how illnesses are perceived and understood, as well as how bodies are approached. They act as an interface between caregiver and patient, observer and observed, redefining the boundaries between the inside and outside of the body. This transformation turns the materiality of the body into a set of variables, images, and data that can be reductionist.

The observation process comes with its own terminology, which can create a gap between the patient's subjective experience and the way medicine objectifies their body.

In the context of the human body, the human sciences often distinguish between a body-object and a body-subject. The body-object is impersonal, governed by natural laws, and devoid of specifically human characteristics, serving as an object of action or contemplation. The body-subject refers to both the subjective body, as the psychophysiological basis of individual experience, and the subject's body, as the dimension of corporeity on which human action is exercised. In healthcare, this distinction helps to relativize and clarify knowledge about the body, whether healthy or ill, without reducing the caregiver's focus to a single aspect of physicality. The body cannot be reduced to a collection of organs, a set of figures or laboratory images, or solely to the patient's personal narrative.",0.7142857142857143,13.945882352941176,False,True,0.7886916399002075,0.8875658313433329,b,False,2,3

**Title:** Knowing How to Diagnose Acute and Chronic Headaches  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

== 1. Identify a Headache (SD-118) ==  
- **Adult and Child of Talking Age:** The patient complains of pain perceived in the cranial cavity, with or without associated facial pain.  
- **Infants and Small Children:** Atypical clinical picture: fits of agitation, head rolled in all directions in the cradle with shrill cries, hostility, algesic mobilization of the head, or on the contrary, a prostrate, analgesic attitude.  

== 2. Reasoning When Faced with a Headache ==  
- **Primary Headaches** are the most common (migraine, tension headache, facial vasculitis, item 99) and are linked to activation of the cephalic nociceptive systems, without any underlying lesion.  
- **Secondary Headaches** have a variety of causes, some of which are very serious. Headache is the main and sometimes only symptom of a local lesion or a general pathology.  
- The primary objective is to distinguish between a primary headache, a benign secondary headache (refractive error), and a headache secondary to a serious condition requiring urgent investigation and treatment (meningeal hemorrhage).  

== 3. Interrogation ==  
- **Temporal Profile:** Crucial part of the diagnostic approach with 4 key questions:  
  - Have you ever had this type of headache (unusual or habitual)?  
  - How long have you had this headache (recent or long-standing)?  
  - How long did it take for the headache to reach its peak? (sudden or gradual nature)  
  - How has the pain evolved since it began (paroxysmal or continuous)?  
- **Other Features:**  
  - If long-standing: number of headache days/month for the last 3 months (episodic or daily)  
  - Duration of each episode/crisis: minutes, hours, days  
  - Location, time of day, type, intensity (VAS from 0 to 10)  
  - Triggering and aggravating factors  
  - Positional character (headache relieved or aggravated by decubitus?)  
  - Behavior: calm, prostrate, goes into the dark, agitated  
- **Context of Occurrence:**  
  - Family and personal history, vascular risk factors  
  - Context: new drug, toxic, carbon monoxide exposure; trauma; pregnancy or post-partum; systemic diseases (cancer, HIV); recent procedure with dural invasion or risk of invasion?  
  - Psychiatric situation, repercussions (sleep, work, social life, schooling)  
- **Associated Signs:**  
  - Digestive: nausea, vomiting  
  - Sensory: photophobia, phonophobia  
  - Facial dysautonomia: lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, ptosis, miosis, eye redness, eye edema  
  - Other pains: cervical, lumbar, limb girdles  
  - Fever, chills  
  - Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs, epileptic seizures, diplopia, visual impairment, eclipses  
- **Treatment Taken for Headaches:** Types of treatment (crisis or preventive), length of time taken, dose, effectiveness, side effects, number of days of painkillers taken per month  

== 4. Physical Examination ==  
- To look for abnormalities that could guide further investigations.  
- Normal in primary headaches (except dysautonomic signs of a facial vascular attack)  
- **General:** Blood pressure, temperature (beware of taking antipyretics, which can mask a fever), heart auscultation, and skin examination (purpura).  
- **Neurological:** Consciousness, meningeal syndrome (stiff neck), focal deficit, particularly cerebellar syndrome (ataxia may go unnoticed in a patient lying down and vomiting).  
- **Neuro-ophthalmological:** Visual field (homonymous lateral hemianopia), oculomotor paralysis (III or VI?), pupillary asymmetry (myosis/mydriasis), ptosis, (¬± papilledema on fundus).  
- **Local:** Inspection/palpation of skull, temporal arteries (if > 50 years old), eyeballs, ears, scalp (shingles), temporomandibular joints, neck.  
- **Postural Character:** Assess the intensity of the headache in the standing position and then in the lying position.  
- **Infant:** Fontanel (bulging?), cranial perimeter (increased?).  

== 5. Determination of Acute or Chronic Nature ==  
- **Any Acute Headache (in the sense of recent and unusual)** is secondary until proven otherwise and requires urgent investigations. In practice:  
  - Any sudden headache is a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) until proven otherwise.  
  - Any progressive headache is a syndrome of intracranial hypertension (ICHT) until proven otherwise.  
  - Any febrile headache with no other obvious cause is meningitis until proven otherwise.  
  - Certain red flags can help guide the diagnosis.  
  - Any recent change in an old, habitual headache raises the suspicion of a secondary headache.  
- A **Chronic** (in the sense of long-standing and habitual) headache is most often primary. The interview must be perfectly detailed, as the diagnosis is based solely on the description of the headache. In practice, a distinction is made between:  
  - Chronic episodic headaches (<15 headache days per month): episodic migraine and episodic tension headache  
  - Chronic daily headaches (CCQ, 15 days or more per month) subdivided into:  
    - Long-term QCC (seizures > 4 hours)  
    - Short-term QCC (attacks < 4 hours)

**Description:** Knowing the procedures for prescribing and dispensing medicines

== Prescription Procedures ==

### Health Professionals Authorized to Prescribe
Prescriptions are made by authorized personnel:

- Physicians (and medical interns by delegation) have large prescribing rights. However, their ability to prescribe may be limited for restricted prescription specialities, which are reserved for certain specialists or hospital practitioners.
- Dental surgeons may prescribe all procedures, products, and services necessary for the practice of dentistry.
- Midwives are authorized to prescribe to women and newborns within the limits of a restrictive list of medicines set by order of the Minister responsible for health.

### Mandatory, Optional, or Restricted Prescribing
Depending on the conditions under which they are prescribed and dispensed, a distinction is made between:

- Specialities subject to compulsory medical prescription.
- Specialities not subject to compulsory prescription. These specialities are available on an optional prescription or for self-medication. Some of these, as defined by the ANSM, may be presented for direct access in pharmacies.
- Restricted prescription specialities:
  - Medication reserved for hospital use.
  - Medicinal product with hospital prescription.
  - Drug with hospital initial prescription.
  - Medication requiring prescription only by certain specialist physicians.
  - Medication requiring particular monitoring during treatment.

### Prescription Using the International Non-Proprietary Name
Since 1 January 2015, all medicines must be prescribed using the international non-proprietary name (INN).

== Delivery Procedures ==

### Health Professionals Authorized to Dispense
Dispensing is the act of dispensing a medicine by a pharmacist.

- The dispensing pharmacist is responsible for dispensing and ensuring the correct use of medicines for outpatients (i.e., not hospitalized patients).
- The health establishment's pharmacy, known as the in-house pharmacy (PUI), is responsible for dispensing medicines and ensuring the correct use of medicines for in-patients. The pharmacist at the PUI, only for PUIs authorized by the Regional Health Agencies (ARS), is also responsible for the ""retrocession"" of certain medicines to non-hospitalized patients. The list of medicines that can be sold to the public by PUIs is limited and published in the Official Journal of the French Republic.

### Checking the Prescription
Dispensing is carried out after checking:

- That the prescription includes all the required information, in particular the date of the prescription, the dosage, and the duration of the treatment; the prescriber's qualifications (initial hospital prescription, prescription reserved for certain specialists, medicines authorized to be prescribed, in particular in the practice of dentistry, to midwives, to chiropodists); completion of the prior or periodic examinations to which the dispensing of certain medicines is subject, where applicable.
- Compliance with the regulations governing the medicines prescribed: whether or not the prescription is secure.

### For How Long?
The duration of the treatment prescribed on the prescription is, except in special cases, a maximum of one year. However, it is dispensed for a maximum period of 4 weeks or 30 days, depending on the packaging. Medicinal products presented in packaging corresponding to a treatment period of more than one month may be dispensed for this period up to a maximum of three months.

**Rubric:** Complementary examinations  

This is an orientation test and has no definitive diagnostic value. A urine dipstick test (BU) is not intended to formally confirm or rule out a urinary tract infection (UTI); clinical evaluation takes precedence. It should only be carried out in patients with suspected community-acquired UTI. In the case of a UTI associated with care or the use of indwelling endo-urinary equipment, the BU is of no value and should not be carried out.

- Check the expiry date of the BU.
- Ensure the patient is not taking any medication that could interfere with the BU reagents (certain antibiotics, vitamin C, phenazopyridine).
- Confirm that the patient's diet provides an adequate supply of nitrates.

Leukocyturia, haematuria, or the presence of nitrites may indicate a UTI, depending on the clinical context. Leukocyturia and haematuria are almost systematic in the presence of endo-urinary material, which is why the BU is not used in these cases. The presence of nitrites requires the presence of nitrates (supplied by the diet) and bacteria carrying a nitrate reductase (enterobacteria) which breaks down nitrates into nitrites.

== It is important to remember that the PPV and NPV of a diagnostic test are dependent on the prevalence of the disease. In studies, the BU has been widely misused and should be used and interpreted as follows: ==

- In the case of a symptomatic patient (male or female), the PPV is excellent (but in the end, the BU merely confirms what a clinical examination has already diagnosed). The NPV in this case has no value and should not be used to rule out the diagnosis of UTI.
- In the case of an asymptomatic patient (male or female), it is the NPV that is excellent (but the BU merely confirms what was already known, since the patient is symptom-free). Its value is therefore extremely limited and its interpretation must be made with great care.

Similarly, populations (diabetics, elderly patients, etc.) at risk of urinary colonization (or asymptomatic bacteriuria) will frequently have a positive BU, which should not indicate a UTI unless the clinical context is suggestive.",0.6,12.860000000000003,False,True,0.8711226582527161,0.6890973647435507,d,False,3,3

**Title:** Diagnosing a Primary Headache  
**Description:** How to rule out a secondary headache and specify the type of primary headache.  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

The diagnostic approach is detailed in item 100. In the absence of biological or radiological markers, the diagnosis is clinical, based on questioning using the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) and a normal clinical examination. This involves the assessment and management of acute pain (SD-259), chronic pain (SD-260), and pain in children and infants (SD-261).

**Rule Out a Secondary Headache**

Questioning identifies any acute, recent, and unusual headache, which must be considered secondary and explored rapidly. It looks for red flags that immediately raise suspicion of a serious cause (item 100). A diagnosis of primary headache should not be made during a first episode. The clinical examination is normal in primary headaches, apart from the dysautonomic signs of an AVF attack.

**Specify the Type of Primary Headache**

Once it is established that the patient is consulting for habitual, long-standing headaches (for at least 3 months, often much longer), the questioning takes place in five stages:

1. **Patient Expression**  
   - Predominant symptoms  
   - Main concerns  

2. **Characterize the Headache**  
   - Duration and frequency of attacks, evolution over time  
   - Topography, intensity, type of pain, aggravating or calming factors (dietary, hormonal, emotional)  

3. **Identify Accompanying Signs**  
   - ""Migraine"" symptoms: nausea, vomiting, photo-/phonophobia, pulsatility  
   - Trigemino-autonomic symptoms: lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, ptosis, miosis, eye redness, edema of the eyelid  
   - Behavior during seizures, agitation  
   - Focal symptoms, postural element  

4. **Patient Context**  
   - Antecedents, context, triggers, infections, trauma, travel, psychiatric situation, repercussions on sleep, work, social life, schooling, etc.  
   - Patient expectations and beliefs about the disease  

5. **Review Treatment History**  
   - Crisis and background treatments, length of time taken, dose, effectiveness, side effects, etc.  
   - Frequency of drug use in the last 3 months (look for abuse), effectiveness of treatments  

The clinical examination is normal in primary headaches. The characteristics of the headache help to make the diagnosis (item 100). The temporal profile is very important: duration of attacks without treatment; number of headache days per month; duration of headaches without treatment.

- **Headache < 15 days/month:** The main causes are episodic migraine and episodic tension headache.
- **Headache ‚â• 15 days/month:** Chronic daily headache (CCQ). A distinction is made between:
  - Short-term CCQ (attacks <4 hours): facial vascular algesia and trigeminal neuralgia.
  - Long-term CCQ (>4 hours): chronic migraine or, more rarely, chronic tension headache, both with or without drug abuse. The pain may be permanent, from waking up to going to bed, and may continue into the night.",1.0,13.372727272727271,False,True,0.8264026045799255,0.6865297754605612,c,True,3,2

Skin tests investigate immediate allergic reactions (type I, IgE) and delayed reactions (type IV, T lymphocytes). Skin test readings are either immediate (15 minutes) or delayed (48 hours).

1. **Prick Tests**  
   - Explore immediate reactions and are performed on the front of the forearm. A drop of the diluted allergen is placed on an area of healthy skin. A small quantity of the allergen is introduced into the epidermis by ""pricking through the drop"" with a microlance or needle. A positive control (a drop of histamine) and a negative control (a drop of saline) are also used. The 15-minute reading is taken.
   - The allergen test is positive if an urticarial lesion appears due to the activation of mast cells carrying specific IgE antibodies to the allergen tested. The diameter of the urticarial papule must be at least 3 mm greater than the papule in the prick test with the negative control (the negative control usually does not produce a papule and is therefore perfectly negative).
   - Two conditions for declaring a prick test with the allergen to be negative: 
     1. No papule on the test itself.
     2. Urticarial papule obtained on the histamine prick test (if there is no urticaria on the histamine test, the skin is not reacting overall, and the negative test with the allergen is uninterpretable).
   - Rare and usually mild side effects of prick tests include widespread local reaction, generalized urticaria, and syndromic reaction (rhinitis, asthma). Exceptional anaphylactic reactions.

2. **Patch Tests**  
   - Explore delayed reactions and are usually performed on the patient's back, also on healthy skin. The allergen is placed in a small occlusive cup left in place for 48 hours. The cup is then removed, and the test is interpreted. The patch is considered positive if the area tested has an eczema-like appearance, indicating a local reaction of the delayed hypersensitivity type.
   - Rare and usually benign side effects of the patch include eczema extending beyond the patch area or even spreading to other areas (exceptional).

3. **Intradermal Reaction (IDR)**  
   - Consists of injecting the allergen intradermally and carrying out either an immediate reading at 15 minutes (investigation of type I hypersensitivity with deep urticaria associating local edema, erythema, and pruritus) or a delayed reading (investigation of type IV hypersensitivity with infiltrated and often pruritic erythema at 48 hours).
   - Rare and usually benign side effects of IDR include those of pricks and patches, depending on the type of reaction investigated. Very rare cases of anaphylaxis occur during these tests, mainly during hymenoptera venom tests and sometimes drug tests.",0.7,14.444545454545459,False,True,0.7572052478790283,0.6577258110046387,c,False,4,4

The newborn is infected in utero following bacteremia of the mother with Listeria monocytogenes. The first stage of infection is colonization of the placenta. This infection is rapidly associated with an intra-uterine infection (chorioamnionitis).

It is estimated that this pathogen is responsible for around 1% of bacterial meningitis in newborns and less than 0.15% of perinatal mortality. After E. coli K1 and SGB, L. monocytogenes remains the third most common cause of neonatal meningitis. The seriousness of listeriosis is therefore due to the bacterium's tropism for the placenta and the central nervous system.

The infection manifests itself from birth with cyanosis, apnea, respiratory distress, and consciousness disorders. In these severe forms, which progress over several days, the mortality rate is high (50-75%). In almost 95% of cases, the disease is purulent meningitis with acute fever in children and adults, insomnia, irritability, and disturbed consciousness.",0.6666666666666666,15.803076923076926,False,True,0.8394573926925659,0.720726748307546,c,False,2,4

A PE at high risk of mortality (severe PE) is a PE associated with hemodynamic failure defined by a systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg or a fall in SBP ‚â• 40 mmHg for more than 15 minutes, in the absence of another cause such as sepsis, arrhythmia, or hypovolemia. This is an absolute life-threatening emergency, given that the risk of mortality is > 30%. There is no place for DD assays in this context.

The management strategy is set out in the algorithm below:

- **Diagnosis**: The reference examination remains the thoracic angioscanner when it can be carried out without delay and when the patient's hemodynamic state allows it. If this is not possible, the diagnosis is based on trans-thoracic echocardiography at the patient's bedside.

- **Therapeutic**: The treatment combines fibrinolysis (in the absence of absolute contraindication) and anticoagulation by HNF until stabilization of the patient who is initially hospitalized in intensive care.

**Rubric:** Care  

## Parent-child bonding  
Parent-child bonding is the result of a maturative process that begins before birth and needs to be promoted during the first few days of life. After birth, skin-to-skin contact with the mother should be encouraged if the condition of the newborn and the mother allow it. Early initiation of breastfeeding (within the first hour) should be offered if breastfeeding is desired. Clinical examinations and care of the newborn are carried out in the presence of the parents. Staying in hospital after giving birth is a good opportunity to support the parents and learn how to care for the newborn. This period also provides an opportunity to observe the family and identify any psycho-social difficulties.

## Breastfeeding (Management of normal and difficult breastfeeding)  
The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. Breastfeeding has many advantages:  
- A nutritional model adapted to physiological needs  
- Reduced risk of infection  
- Prevention of atopy  
- Contribution to the mother-child bond  
- Economic advantage  

Breastfeeding should begin early (within the first hour of life). The mother should be given information on:  
- Correct positioning of the newborn  
- Correct latching of the baby  
- Nipple hygiene  
- Stopping smoking and alcohol consumption  
- The frequency and duration of feeds (breastfeeding on demand, 8 to 12 feeds)  
- Assessing the effectiveness of breastfeeding (stools several times a day, copious urination, weight gain 200-250g per week)  
- Administration of vitamin K at 1 month of age and daily administration of vitamin D (1000 to 1200 IU)  
- Complications of breastfeeding (insufficient lactation, sore and cracked nipples, engorgement, lymphangitis)  
- Start of dietary diversification between 4 and 6 months of age  

Contraindications to breastfeeding are rare (maternal HIV infection, maternal heart or kidney disease, galactosemia in children, certain drugs).

## Regular medical check-ups  
- 14 medical examinations during the first 3 years, including 1 in the first week, 1 in the second week, and one a month until the child is 6 months old  
- Preventive measures (unexpected infant death syndrome, transmission of infections, domestic accidents)  
- Risks associated with passive smoking

**Title:** Know the positive clinical and/or biological elements that allow the diagnosis of menopause to be made.

== Typical Form ==
In its typical form, the positive diagnosis is primarily clinical and is based on the association of:

- An amenorrhoea of at least 12 months
- Occurring around the age of 50
- Associated with climacteric symptoms (though climacteric symptoms may be absent).

In the typical form, there is no room for biological confirmation of the diagnosis.

The search for other diagnoses of amenorrhoea should be taken into account depending on the patient's age (necessary if under 40).

== Special Cases ==
In the case of hysterectomy, the diagnosis will be based on the conditions of the hysterectomy, the existence of climacteric symptoms, and/or the patient's age.

In the case of oestroprogestogenic contraception or amenorrhoea induced by certain contraceptives or hormonal treatments, the diagnosis of menopause can be difficult. Biological assays can be used (FSH > 30 IU/ml and estradiol < 10-20 pg/ml). However, these assays can be distorted by the use of hormonal contraception, and there is considerable variability in these assays during the perimenopausal phase.

The strategy proposed is most often to stop the treatment in progress and monitor the clinical situation (onset of amenorrhoea).",1.0,12.286666666666669,False,True,0.8391017913818359,0.742890993754069,c,False,4,3

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Definition

There is no legal relationship between the doctor, a public hospital employee, and the patient. Both are only legally bound to the public health establishment. In the case of acts performed by hospital doctors, it is the responsibility of the public health establishment that is brought before the administrative courts: administrative tribunal, administrative court of appeal, Conseil d'Etat.

Administrative jurisprudence has defined a typology of faults likely to engage the liability of the public service:

- **Official Misconduct:** Misconduct committed by a public official in the performance of duties, i.e., while on duty, using official resources, and without any personal interest.

- **Fault in the Organisation and Operation of the Department:** This may include inadequate supervision of patients or premises, poor maintenance of premises and equipment, poor coordination between doctors, etc.

A distinction must be made between personal misconduct or misconduct detached from the service, which gives rise to personal civil liability on the part of the perpetrator. There are two possible scenarios:

- It was committed outside the service and has no connection with the service (e.g., misconduct committed by a doctor in providing care in a private setting).

- It was committed on the ward but was not related to it because of the perpetrator's malicious intent or its exceptional seriousness (e.g., the refusal of the on-call surgeon to attend to a gunshot wounded patient even though he had been warned by the resident of the seriousness of the patient's condition).",0.9090909090909091,20.05826086956522,False,True,0.7860521674156189,0.7120046814282736,c,False,2,3

The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is exclusively clinical.

== Clinical Aspects According to Disease Stage ==

- **Acute Phase:** Acute eczema characterized by erythema, oedema, vesicles that rupture leading to oozing and crusts, pruritus, and crumbled contours.

- **Chronic Phase:** Erythematosquamous lesions and/or lichenification, which is the thickening of the skin with an irregular squared appearance.

== Location of Lesions by Age ==

- **Infants:** Lesions start on the face and scalp, extending to the sides of the limbs and trunk. The area under the nappy and mid-face area (nose) is spared.

- **Early Childhood:** Lesions are localized in the flexion creases of the limbs (knees, elbows) and often the ankles.

- **Older Children:** Frequent lichenification induced by chronic scratching.

- **Adolescents and Adults:** Lesions appear on the face and neck, with rare but typical localizations such as lips (atopic cheilitis), eyelids with possible ophthalmological complications (keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis), and lower limbs (lichenification, prurigo).

== Development ==

Atopic dermatitis (AD) most often begins in the first 12 months of life. It usually develops in winter flare-ups but can develop continuously in severe forms. Improvement or even ""cure"" often occurs in childhood, but 3 to 5% of children progress to an adult form, particularly those with a severe form. A late onset in adulthood is possible but rare, requiring a differential diagnosis to rule out other conditions such as scabies, contact eczema, or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

== Definitions ==

### a) Hygienic Dietary Rules

Hygienic dietary rules are a major element in the therapeutic management of haemorrhoidal disease. Dietary exclusion diets are not effective. Generally speaking, dietary hygiene rules aim to combat chronic constipation. Treating chronic constipation is a common-sense measure aimed at limiting the onset of haemorrhoidal disease, preventing recurrences, and perhaps even complications. Dietary changes that help to correct stool consistency and regulate transit are recommended. Introducing a diet rich in soluble fiber (linseed, chia seeds, blond psyllium, etc.) and correcting constipation can reduce the time spent having a bowel movement and reduce dyschezia. This helps to resolve symptoms in the acute phase of haemorrhoidal attacks, prevent attacks, and treat chronic haemorrhoidal disease.

### b) Medication

**Treatment of Internal Haemorrhoidal Disease:**

Diosmin has proven efficacy in the treatment of haemorrhoidal attacks because it reduces the intensity and duration of symptoms. Local topicals include all emollient products for topical application (creams, ointments, and suppositories). They contain agents capable of reducing the inflammatory component of the haemorrhoidal crisis, acting on the oedematous component of the crisis, and promoting healing. Some topicals also have analgesic properties through local anaesthetics. Like the class of venotonics, these drugs are offered as short courses of treatment for haemorrhoidal attacks. They are not indicated in cases of chronic pathology, mainly dominated by bleeding or defecatory anal procidence.

**Treatment of External Haemorrhoidal Disease:**

The only manifestation of external haemorrhoids is external haemorrhoidal thrombosis, which is treated by incision or excision. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are an alternative to incision/excision. Short courses of corticosteroids are an alternative in cases where NSAIDs and surgical treatment are contraindicated, particularly where there is a strong oedematous component.

### c) Principles of Instrumental and Surgical Treatments

The term ""instrumental haemorrhoid treatment"" refers to all procedures carried out to constrain the haemorrhoidal anal procidence, reinforce the supporting tissue, and form a scar at the top of the haemorrhoid. These therapeutic methods are carried out on an outpatient basis, through an anoscopy, and most often during a specialised gastroenterology consultation. These strategies constitute the basic treatment for chronic haemorrhoidal disease. They should not be carried out during a flare-up of the disease and do not represent a preventive treatment for external haemorrhoidal thrombosis. Various techniques can be used to create a chemical (sclerosis), ischaemic (elastic ligation), or thermal (infrared, bipolar coagulation, cryotherapy) eschar. The treatment is applied in a sector, in the rectal mucosa (no thermoalgesic sensitivity) above (and not on top of) the internal haemorrhoidal tissue. These methods do not remove or sclerotise the haemorrhoidal tissue itself. When the indications are well-targeted, they provide significant benefit more than three times out of four. However, their effectiveness decreases with the length of follow-up. These methods may give rise to rare complications (bleeding following the fall of an eschar, infections). Elastic ligation offers the best risk/benefit ratio but is contraindicated in patients taking anticoagulants.

""Surgical haemorrhoid treatment"" describes all procedures designed to treat haemorrhoidal tissue under general, peridural, or locoregional anaesthetic. There are two types of haemorrhoidal surgery: those which remove the haemorrhoidal tissue (known as haemorrhoidectomy) and those which fix or tighten the haemorrhoidal tissue using a mechanical process (pexy with wire or mechanical forceps) or heat (radiofrequency, laser). The first type is the benchmark in terms of effectiveness and is often the only procedure possible in cases of anatomically advanced haemorrhoidal disease or recurrent external thrombosis. The second type is more similar to the instrumental treatments mentioned above: it is simpler, often quicker, and less painful. Patients are often immobilised for a shorter period after the procedure. There is a greater risk of recurrence. Complications are inherent in any type of surgery, but rare functional sequelae such as incontinence must be prevented and assessed before the procedure.

The treatment of external haemorrhoidal thrombosis is not, strictly speaking, a surgical procedure. However, an incision or excision can easily be performed in consultation. With a few precautions and a little patience, this strategy is effective in relieving pain and shortening its course. The alternative is to prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",1.0,14.895384615384618,False,True,0.7789837121963501,0.6809496084849039,c,True,5,2

Pregnant women are monitored for toxoplasmosis by monthly serological screening: toxoplasmosis IgG and IgM testing is mandatory when pregnancy is declared (unless previous maternal immunity has been documented).

In non-immune women, serology should be repeated monthly until delivery, due to the high frequency of inapparent forms of maternal toxoplasmosis (80%).

The steps to be taken in the event of positive maternal serology are as follows:

1. **Dating Maternal Contamination**  
   - It's straightforward if seroconversion occurs during serological monitoring.
   - If serology is positive with the presence of IgG and IgM in early pregnancy, the IgG avidity index should be used as a guide: a high value indicates a long-standing infection. A reference laboratory should also be called in to repeat all the maternal samples to assess how far the infection has progressed and when it occurred.

2. **Confirmed Seroconversion During Pregnancy**  
   - The patient should be referred to a Centre Pluridisciplinaire de Diagnostic Pr√©natal (CPDPN) for further treatment.

**Rubric:** Definition  

**Definitions**

Illness, disability, or accident can alter a person's intellectual or physical faculties and prevent them from expressing their wishes and defending their interests alone. This person may be placed under a legal protection measure, which consists of appointing another person to assist or represent them in their interests. This measure must be proportionate and individualized, and must be introduced and implemented with respect for the protected person's freedoms, rights, and dignity.

The 2007 law reforming the legal protection of adults strengthened the fundamental rights of protected persons. For example, the person concerned must be heard during the procedure for placing them under guardianship. The 2019 Act also strengthened the rights of protected adults by promoting their autonomy wherever possible. Protected persons must receive from the person in charge of their protection measure, in a manner appropriate to their condition, all information concerning them.

**Protection of Persons of Full Age**

A person who has reached the age of majority is legally considered capable of carrying out all acts of civil life. However, a legal protection measure may be put in place when a person finds it impossible to look after his or her own interests due to a medically certified impairment of his or her mental and/or physical faculties.

People can anticipate their loss of autonomy by drawing up a future protection mandate. This enables people to choose in advance who will be responsible for protecting their interests when they are no longer able to do so.

**Protection of Minors**

A minor child may be placed under guardianship, whereby a person helps to protect the child's interests. Guardianship is opened when the holders of parental authority (the child's parents) can no longer exercise it (because the child has no parents, they are deceased, or their parental authority has been withdrawn).

**Protecting People with Disabilities**

Parents can take steps to protect the interests of their child (minor or adult) with a disability when they are no longer able to do so. This protective measure begins when the parents die or are no longer able to care for their child. If the child is a minor, the parents can apply for guardianship of minors to protect his or her interests. If the child is of full age, they can use the future protection mandate.

Adults under court protection or guardianship exercise their rights personally and receive information relating to their state of health directly. The curator may only receive this information from the doctor if the protected person authorizes him to do so. Like any other patient, a protected adult must personally consent to the medical procedure under consideration. Consent may be withdrawn at any time and refusal must be respected, except in emergencies. Medical records are released at the patient's request, using the same procedure as for other adults.

**The Rights of Adult Patients Under Guardianship**

Medical information is given to the guardian. Once the guardian has access to information about the protected person's health, he or she must respect medical confidentiality. However, the adult under guardianship has the right to receive the information directly and to participate in the decision-making process concerning him or her. This information and this participation in the decision will then be adapted to the faculties of the protected person.

The consent of adults under guardianship must be systematically sought if they are able to express their wishes and participate in decisions concerning them. Consent may be revoked at any time. The consent of the legal representative alone must remain exceptional. In addition, except in emergencies, the guardian may not, without the judge's authorization, take a decision that would seriously affect the integrity of the protected person or the privacy of his or her private life. Lastly, the doctor has the right to provide essential care if the guardian refuses, which could have serious consequences for the health of the protected adult.

In a guardianship situation, in principle, the medical file cannot be communicated to the protected person, but only to the guardian as his legal representative. However, it is the guardian's responsibility, as far as possible, to inform the protected adult of the contents of the medical file.

**Title:** Knowing the Definition of Medical Error

**Rubric:** Definition

**Definitions**

Human beings are fallible, and it is in their nature to make mistakes. Acknowledging that we can make mistakes is a prerequisite for adopting error-prevention behavior. Recognizing that we have made a mistake is an opportunity to learn and progress. This is true for individuals and organizations. When an organization implements systems for identifying, analyzing, and preventing errors, it is referred to as a ""learning organization.""

An error of omission occurs when a necessary action has not been taken. An error by commission refers to an action that was carried out but was not useful. An error of execution refers to an action that was poorly carried out.

A violation (or non-compliance) occurs when a recommendation or professional rule is not respected. This non-compliance may be routine (a bad habit), the result of personal prioritization (to save time, for example), or induced by the context (over-activity, urgency, etc.).

Errors in care may relate to preventive, diagnostic, or treatment actions. They may or may not have resulted in harm to the patient. They are unintentional and avoidable. A serious adverse event (SAE) occurs when the harm is a death, a serious complication, or, at the very least, a one-day stay in the hospital.

**Types of Error**

- **Omission:** Occurs when a necessary action has not been taken.
- **Commission:** Refers to an action that was carried out but was not useful.
- **Execution:** Refers to an action that was poorly carried out.

**Title:** Understanding the Mechanisms of Hypernatremia  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**

Physiologically, water balance is maintained when inputs (drinking water and food, production of water by intracellular oxidation) are equivalent to outputs (precisely regulated renal, cutaneous, respiratory, and digestive). Thirst regulates input, and the kidney ensures balance by regulating output to keep both intra- and extra-cellular osmolality constant.

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. It is transported to the posterior pituitary gland for secretion. ADH secretion is regulated by variations in plasma osmolality (around 1%) and plasma volume (between 10 and 15%).

ADH acts on the main cells of the collecting duct by binding to its specific V2 receptors at their basal pole. This binding leads to the expression of water channels, type 2 aquaporins, on the apical membrane. ADH thus enables the permeability of the collecting duct to water, and therefore the final urinary osmolality, to be varied finely. The second necessary condition for water reabsorption is the existence of an osmolar concentration gradient between the tubular fluid and the interstitium, a condition which is physiologically achieved by the creation of a corticopapillary gradient.

When ADH is not secreted or is ineffective, the sensation of thirst prevents a negative water balance. This is very important in clinical situations, as intracellular dehydration only occurs when thirst is ineffective (coma, psychiatric disorders, sedation in intensive care, elderly or overly young patients).

A negative water balance and hyperosmolality (hypernatremia) may therefore be observed in cases of:
- Cutaneous or respiratory extrarenal water loss
- Abnormalities in the thirst centers (adipsia) or hypothalamic osmoreceptors
- Renal water loss due to lack of ADH secretion or lack of renal sensitivity to ADH, responsible for diabetes insipidus resulting in a polyuro-polydipsic syndrome

Intracellular dehydration without hypernatremia:
- Plasma hyperosmolality is secondary to the abnormal presence of a solute other than sodium, of low molecular weight and osmotically active. This solute is responsible for an ""osmotic gap"" defined as the difference between measured and calculated osmolality. This solute may be mannitol, ethylene glycol, etc.
- When the solute diffuses freely into the cells (urea, ethanol), it is said to be osmotically inactive and will not cause any disturbance to intracellular hydration.",0.8571428571428571,17.2,False,True,0.780899167060852,0.6570147275924683,b,False,2,4

**Rubric:** Definition  

**Definitions**

Clinical research is regulated by legislation, primarily in France by the Public Health Code, which defines the legal framework for clinical research and the obligations of those involved, and the Jard√© Law, which defines Research Involving the Human Person (RIPH).

The Jard√© Law (2012, effective 2016) distinguishes three categories of research conducted on human beings to develop biological or medical knowledge:

- **Interventional research (RIPH category 1):** Involves interventions not justified by usual care and not devoid of risk, primarily studies on the efficacy and safety of medicines or medical devices.

- **Minimal risk and minimal burden interventional research (category 2 MHIR):** Involves adding interventions to standard practice with only minimal risks and burdens, excluding research on medicinal products and medical devices, which fall under category 1.

- **Non-interventional research (RIPH category 3):** Involves procedures and products used in the usual way, without additional or unusual diagnostic, treatment, or monitoring procedures, and without additional risks or constraints.

**Clarification on Experimental vs. Interventional**

- All experimental studies are interventional, but not all interventional studies are experimental.
- An interventional study is defined by the regulatory framework: some observational studies may be interventional if specific data collection methods are used for the study or if the patient's medical monitoring schedule is modified.

**Roles in Research**

- **Promoter:** The individual or entity that initiates, manages, and funds the research, legally responsible for it. All RIPH must have a promoter.
  
- **Investigator:** The individual who directs and supervises the research at a site, following the protocol.

**Information and Consent**

Research participants must be informed before inclusion. Information must be appropriate, complete, fair, and comprehensible. Informed consent is required for category 1 or 2 RIPH, or non-opposition for category 3 RIPH, before inclusion.

**Role of the Comit√© de Protection des Personnes (CPP):**

Composed of health professionals and civil society members, the CPP ensures research complies with legal conditions and provides opinions on the scientific validity and ethical aspects. All RIPH must be authorized by a CPP before commencing.

**Authorizations**

Other authorizations from structures or bodies (e.g., CNIL, ANSM) are required before launching an RIPH. The complexity of obtaining these authorizations depends on the RIPH category.

**Non-IPHR Research**

Research not classified as IPHR is not subject to the Jard√© Law or CPP authorization but must be submitted to the CNIL if it involves personal data. This includes research based on retrospective data, cosmetics research, satisfaction surveys, and experiments in the human and social sciences in health.",1.0,9.087500000000002,False,True,0.7003656029701233,0.7703775962193807,a,False,1,3

- *Staphylococcus saprophyticus* is also a pathogenic agent frequently encountered during cystitis in young women, particularly during the summer period. *Staphylococcus saprophyticus* is a gram-positive cocci bacterium that does not have a nitrate reductase enzyme, which explains the absence of nitrites in the urine sample during true UTIs.

**Risk Factors for ESBL or Fluoroquinolone Resistance:**

- A history of infection or colonization with EBLSE in the previous 3 months.
- Antibiotic therapy with one of the following in the previous 3 months: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, C2G, C3G, fluoroquinolones.
- Travel to an EBLSE-endemic area (southern Europe, Mediterranean basin, Middle East, India, southeast Asia).

- **C. difficile Toxin Testing:** Should be requested in adults in the event of diarrhoea following hospitalisation (nosocomial) and/or post-antibiotic treatment. C. difficile diarrhoea is rare in children and virtually non-existent before the age of 4, due to the absence of a toxin receptor. However, children are readily colonised by C. difficile, including toxin-secreting organisms, so there is no need to test for C. difficile in young children.

**Epidemiology of Prostate Cancer**

- Prostate cancer is the most common tumor in men over the age of 50.
- Median age at diagnosis is 68.
- It is the most common cancer in men, with approximately 51,000 cases annually, surpassing lung cancer (around 31,200 cases per year) and colorectal cancer (around 23,200 cases).
- The incidence is about 51,000 new cases per year (estimation period: 2007 - 2016) with a standardized mortality rate of 10 per 100,000 cases, equating to approximately 8,700 deaths per year (estimation period: 2007 - 2014).
- In terms of mortality, prostate cancer is the third most common cancer, with 8,700 deaths, following lung cancer (around 22,700 deaths) and colorectal cancer (around 9,200 deaths).

**Screening and Early Diagnosis**

Screening for prostate cancer is not recommended. However, early diagnosis is advised for men who:

- Have a life expectancy greater than 10 years.
- Are between the ages of 50 and 70, or 40-45 if there is a family or ethnic risk factor.
- Undergo a risk-benefit analysis.

**Rubric:** Definition  

== Main complications of valve prosthesis wearers ==

==== Thrombo-embolic complications ====

Thromboembolic complications are one of the most frequent complications. They mainly concern mechanical valves, but also biological prostheses, particularly those implanted percutaneously. They are more frequent in the first year.

Three main risk factors have been identified:

- Prosthesis in mitral/tricuspid position versus aortic position (lower pressure regime)
- Presence of atrial fibrillation or left ventricular dysfunction
- Old generation mechanical prosthesis

A poorly balanced INR remains the main cause of thrombo-embolic complications in the case of mechanical valves.

In the case of mitral and aortic prostheses, they are manifested by systemic embolisms, potentially cerebral (TIA or stroke), more rarely embolisms responsible for acute limb ischaemia, splenic or renal infarction.

More rarely, obstructive prosthesis thrombosis may occur. The clinical presentation is usually very noisy, with a picture of PAO or cardiogenic shock. Auscultation is altered but not pathognomonic (systolic murmur for an aortic prosthesis or diastolic murmur for a prosthesis in the mitral position).

Diagnosis is essentially paraclinical, with TTE and TEE showing an increase in trans-valvular gradients, a reduction in the functional valve area, and sometimes an image of thrombus visible on the prosthesis. In the case of mechanical prostheses, radiocinema of the valve can also reveal blockage or reduced mobility of the leaflets.

INR measurement is essential in any clinical situation where there is a suspicion of prosthesis thrombosis.

The management of acute prosthesis thrombosis may require emergency surgery, with a high mortality rate (around 30%).

In sub-acute forms or those with minor dysfunction, or in inoperable patients, correction of anticoagulation or the addition of an anti-aggregant, or even thrombolysis, may be suggested.

The main differential diagnosis remains infective endocarditis.

==== Prosthesis disinsertion ====

Disinsertion of a prosthesis is responsible for a para-prosthetic leak, i.e., between the valve annulus and the Dacron or Teflon flange. The main aetiology to look for and evoke remains, above all, infective endocarditis. Suture loosening without infectious origin is also possible.

The clinical picture is one of aortic or mitral insufficiency, with severity and rate of onset depending on the speed of onset and grade of the leak.

Auscultation therefore reveals a diastolic aortic murmur or a systolic murmur at the mitral focus.

Biological tests may reveal haemolytic anaemia (increased LDH, reduced haptoglobin, and presence of shizocytes), more frequently in the mitral position.

The key examination is TTE (and TEE), which reveals a Doppler flow of para-prosthetic regurgitation.

Depending on the severity and rapidity of the leak, management may range from simple monitoring to surgical intervention. In cases where surgery is contraindicated, or in subjects at high risk of surgery, percutaneous closure may be discussed.

The TEE of a paraprosthetic mitral leak is used for diagnosis.

==== Degeneration of bioprostheses ====

The main disadvantage of bioprostheses is that they degenerate over time. This degeneration most often expresses itself in a stenosing mode, more rarely in a receding mode (which generally progresses more rapidly) or in a mixed mode.

The average time before the appearance of ultrasound signs of degeneration is around 8 years.

The risk factors are male gender, implantation at a young age, renal insufficiency, abnormal calcium metabolism, dyslipidaemia, patient/prosthesis mismatch, and bioprostheses in the mitral position.

Management ranges from simple monitoring in early forms to replacement of the degenerated prosthesis (either surgically or percutaneously).

Bioprosthesis degeneration is a common issue.

==== Infectious endocarditis (IE) ====

This is a complication that should be systematically investigated in the event of a complication in a patient with a valve prosthesis.

The 5-year incidence of AR in valve prosthesis patients is around 5%, with the majority of events occurring in the first year following implantation.

Early postoperative AEs (<1 year after implantation) are mainly linked to ""Staphylococcus epidermitis"" or ""Aureus"".

Conversely, late postoperative AEs (>1 year after implantation) have a bacterial ecology similar to AEs on native valves (Staphylococci, Enterococci, Streptococci).

Management is discussed on a case-by-case basis, depending on the patient's clinical condition and comorbidities, and the echocardiographic features of the IE. Antibiotic treatment is systematic, lasting at least 6 weeks, and may be combined with surgical management.

==== Hemorrhagic complications associated with VKAs ====

They concern patients with mechanical valves, but also patients with biological valves where curative anticoagulation is indicated (AF in particular). The risk is approximately 2% patient-years.

The symptoms vary: cerebral haemorrhage, digestive haemorrhage, haematuria, gingivorrhage, etc. A thorough clinical examination to look for any signs of seriousness is essential.

Management is the same as for an overdose of VKA (see Item 183).",0.8571428571428571,11.693684210526317,False,True,0.7939205765724182,0.553435206413269,c,False,2,4

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Author:** CFEU: Proofreading  

== Definitions ==  

The diagnostic approach to micturition disorders begins with a careful clinical history, followed by a clinical examination. One or more long-term consultations are often necessary. Questioning of the parents and the child should look for:

- Signs of urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly, such as pollakiuria, urgency, daytime leaks when not urinating, and/or nocturnal leaks, with the date of onset of the problems and any notion of urinary infection.
- How and at what age the child learned to be toilet trained.
- The child's psychomotor and statural development, living habits, daily water intake, schooling, and leisure activities.
- Any use of protection and the psychosocial impact of bladder weakness.
- Any history of functional problems in the parents or siblings.
- Notions of malformative uropathy.
- Abdominal pain and anorectal problems.
- The existence of psychiatric disorders (e.g., ADHD), developmental disorders, sleep and obstructive disorders, and the family context in which the child is growing up.

== Differential Diagnoses ==  

This will enable us to rule out the main differential diagnoses, namely:

- In girls, vaginal micturition, which manifests as urine leakage often after micturition, without micturition problems. Vaginal micturition is associated with an inappropriate micturition position.
- Isolated urinary incontinence with laughter.
- Stress incontinence: urinary leakage during physical exercise or when coughing or sneezing.

== Clinical Examination ==  

The clinical examination begins with an inspection of the underwear for signs of urine leakage or soiling, followed by a search for a bladder globe. The following tests should be carried out:

- Examination of the external genitalia, including the appearance of the penis, any abnormality of the vulva, and irritation of the genitals and vulva.
- Observation of urination, if possible, is informative.
- Abdominal palpation to look for stercoral congestion and a bladder globe.
- Complete neurological examination, assessing motor skills of the lower limbs and perineal sensitivity, and searching for skin stigmata in the lumbosacral region, sometimes discreet, in favor of a spinal dysraphism.
- Neuro-orthopaedic examination, including assessment for hollow foot, unequal length of lower limbs, scoliosis, and trophic disorders in favor of an associated neurological pathology.

A 48-hour voiding diary is a simple and highly informative tool, which complements the interview and enables pollakiuria to be confirmed and quantified, and the severity of urinary incontinence to be assessed. Its purpose is to record the frequency of micturition, the volume urinated (in ml), and the existence of urine leakage. It is very useful for characterizing the bladder-sphincter behavior of children, differentiating pollakiuria from polyuria, and assessing the extent of urine leakage.",0.9,16.98,False,True,0.7160029411315918,0.6138556996981303,b,False,4,3

- Know the clinical signs of hypoglycaemia.
- Be familiar with the drugs that cause hypoglycaemia: sulphonamides, glinides, and insulin.
- Be aware of high-risk situations, such as:
  - A light meal without reducing insulin doses.
  - A long delay between the injection of rapid-acting insulin and the meal.
  - Heavy physical exertion without reducing insulin doses or having a snack.
  - An error in insulin dose or sulphonamide/glinide intake.

**Definitions**

Macroscopic hematuria is a major warning sign, but the etiological assessment can be carried out on an outpatient basis. Hospitalization is required if there are clinical or biological repercussions such as bladder or ureteral clotting, deglobulation, sepsis, or renal failure. Persistent hematuria can lead to chronic anemia.

Significant hemorrhage may cause clotting (fresh blood in the urinary tract) in the bladder and/or ureter. The appearance of visible clots and/or recent dysuria raises concerns about progression to Acute Urine Retention (Vesical Urine Retention 347), where hematuria and a bladder globe indicate bladder clotting. Lower back pain suggests renal colic due to ureteral clotting.

Clinically, a ""bladder globe"" and/or ""renal colic"" must be ruled out. The clinical signs (tachycardia, arterial hypotension, mottling leading to fears of hypovolemia requiring blood replenishment, additional sepsis due to urine stasis) and biological repercussions (anemia, additional hemostasis problems, renal failure, etc.) must be assessed.",1.0,16.462500000000002,False,True,0.7955674529075623,0.7492263913154602,c,False,2,3

**Title:** Knowing the modes of transmission of infectious diseases (contact, droplets, air, environment)  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

Infectious diseases are transmitted horizontally between individuals in three ways: contact, droplets, and air, or from the environment. Transmission may be direct, where the infectious agent passes from the reservoir to the host without an intermediary, or indirect, requiring an inert or living vector between the reservoir and the host. Some infectious agents can be transmitted by several methods.

Vertical transmission refers to the transmission of the infectious agent from mother to child.

**1. Direct Horizontal Transmission from One Person to Another**

- **By Direct Contact:** Transmission occurs through touching, kissing, sexual intercourse, breaking the skin, transfusion, or exposure to blood or biological fluids. This involves physical contact between the host and the source of the infectious agent. Special case: the hands of healthcare professionals are often considered as intermediary vectors between two patients (this is referred to as indirect contact). Note: 'Sexual transmission' describes transmission by direct sexual contact. 'Faecal-oral transmission' describes transmission by indirect contact of a micro-organism between a faecal reservoir and an oral portal of entry.

- **Oral-Tracheal-Bronchial Secretions:** Pfl√ºgge droplets are emitted when speaking, coughing, spitting, blowing the nose, or sneezing. They carry micro-organisms which are deposited on the mucous membranes (nose, eyes, mouth) of the receptive individual. These droplets are larger than 5 ¬µm in diameter and can be transmitted over short distances (~2 metres). Droplet transmission is frequently associated with contact transmission when the micro-organism can survive in the environment.

- **Airborne Transmission:** Micro-organisms are transmitted by droplet nuclei (particles less than 5 ¬µm in diameter) emitted by infected or colonised individuals. These airborne particles can remain in suspension for several hours and can be carried by air currents over long distances (several metres). This aerosol is then inhaled by the receptive host.

**2. Direct Horizontal Transmission from an Animal to a Person (Zoonosis)**

- **By Direct Contact:** Occurs when an animal bites, scratches, or licks injured skin or mucous membranes.
- Direct contact with or inhalation of aerosols of contaminated biological fluids or excrement.
- By eating food of animal origin, particularly meat and dairy products.

**3. Indirect Horizontal Transmission Between the Reservoir and the Host**

This occurs via an intermediary, on or in which the micro-organism can multiply or survive. This intermediary is either an inert vehicle or carrier, or a living vector.

- **Vehicle or Inert Environmental Medium:**
  - Food or water contaminated by biological fluids or excrement of human or animal origin (if the infectious agent can survive in the external environment).
  - Objects soiled or contaminated by contact: kitchen utensils, clothing, soiled surfaces, care materials, surgical instruments.
  - Soil: contamination of a wound by the spores of telluric bacteria.
  - Airborne particles from an environmental reservoir or contaminated water aerosols.

- **Living Vectors:** For active transmission between an infected host and a receptive host (person or animal), mainly arthropods (insects, ticks, lice, fleas, etc.); but also intermediate hosts essential to the cycle of certain infectious agents (molluscs, cattle, or wild mammals for certain parasites, for example) and transmitting the latter passively (e.g., consumption of their flesh) and/or indirectly (e.g., elimination of the infectious agent in faeces) via the environment.

**4. Vertical Transmission from Mother to Child**

Transmission can occur by the transplacental haematogenous route during pregnancy, by the ascending transcervical route, by the genital tract at the time of delivery, or during breast-feeding.",0.8571428571428571,12.62714285714286,False,True,0.7893226742744446,0.7359027067820231,c,False,5,3

**Definitions**

The main symptom reported is chronic abdominal pain, spasm-like, most often localized in the left iliac fossa or hypogastrium (but may be present over the entire colonic frame). It is usually not present at night and may be exacerbated by eating. The pain is intermittent and occurs in fits and starts. It is often aggravated by episodes of stress or anxiety and subsides during periods of rest, such as holidays. The pain is linked to transit, with improvement or worsening after defecation.

Abdominal bloating and a subjective feeling of fullness or abdominal discomfort are very often associated.

The second key symptom of the disease is transit disorders. This may be constipation, clinically defined as fewer than 3 bowel movements per week, hard stools, or difficulty in evacuating. There may be diarrhea, defined as frequent stools, i.e., at least 3 a day (often postprandial, soft to liquid). These bowel movements may be urgent, and some patients develop toilet-seeking syndrome (locating available toilets in anticipation of a journey), or alternating diarrhea and constipation.

IBS is often associated with other functional symptoms. These include functional dyspepsia with the presence of upper gastrointestinal symptoms (early satiety, pyrosis, epigastric heaviness), fibromyalgia (diffuse myalgias and arthralgias with no organic substrate), and chronic fatigue syndrome.",0.8888888888888888,13.450000000000003,False,True,0.7827010154724121,0.5848031838734945,b,False,5,2

Imaging tests are indicated to confirm the diagnosis of renal colic (within 24 hours if uncomplicated and urgently if complicated renal colic), assess its severity (single kidney, urinoma), and later confirm whether the stone has been expelled. Recommended imaging includes renal-vesical ultrasound/ASP (for simple renal colic or stone follow-up) or ideally a low-dose abdominal-pelvic CT scan without contrast injection (within 24 hours for simple renal colic and urgently for complicated renal colic).

In emergencies, a CT scan with contrast may be used if there is diagnostic uncertainty on non-contrast sections (absence of obstruction, absence of dilatation) to rule out differential diagnoses such as splenic infarction, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or retro-caecal appendicitis.

**In Non-Emergency Setting:**  
Imaging is indicated to determine the dimensions, number of calculi, their location, and UH density to deduce composition and probability of spontaneous expulsion, guiding the most appropriate treatment technique. A uro CT scan is recommended in this setting, according to AFU 2022 Lithiasis Committee recommendations.

== Definitions ==

Questioning and clinical examination should enable a distinction to be made between:

- Enlargement of the bursa: painful (torsion, orchi-epididymitis, scrotal trauma) and non-painful (inguinal hernia, hydrocele and cord cyst, testicular tumors, testicular cancer 313, varicocele)
- A testicular migration disorder (cryptorchidism)
- Anomalies of the penis: phimosis (congenital or acquired), paraphimosis, cancer of the penis, discoloration of the penis (congenital or acquired)
- Anomalies of the urethral meatus (stenosis, hypospadias, epispadias)

== Painful Enlargement of the Bursae ==

- **Spermatic Cord Torsion:** Any acute painful bursa is a spermatic cord torsion until proven otherwise, regardless of age. It manifests as acute, intense, unilateral, sudden scrotal pain, usually nocturnal. The pain is continuous, with no analgesic position, and radiates towards the inguinal region, along the spermatic cord towards the iliac fossa. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The bursa is painful, enlarged, sometimes red and warm. During lifting maneuvers, the bursa remains painful (negative Prehn's sign). The testicle is elevated and retracted at the inguinal ring. The cremasteric reflex is absent.

- **Orchiepididymitis:** Before puberty and after age 35, orchiepididymitis is usually associated with urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, HPV, and trichomoniasis. From puberty to age 35, it is often secondary to an STI. It presents as painful enlargement of a bursa, possibly with progressive fever. Pain is associated with local signs: scrotal pain radiating along the cord, progressive onset, painful induration of the cord and epididymis. The scrotum is inflamed. Lifting the testicle usually relieves the pain (positive Prehn's sign). Any doubt about torsion should lead to surgical exploration.

- **Scrotal Trauma:** Typically occurs in young patients following direct perineal or scrotal trauma, presenting with acute, intense scrotal pain. Clinical examination reveals a large non-inflammatory bursa (haematocele), with a scrotal hematoma. Transillumination is negative. Lesions may include scrotal hematoma, intra-testicular hematoma, haematocele, testicular contusion, testicular fracture, and lesions of the testicular appendages.

== Painless, Enlarged Bursa ==

- **Testicular Cancer:** Testicular cancers occur in young men (aged 15-35). Cryptorchidism is the main risk factor. Testicular cancer is discovered through autopalpation, infertility tests, gynecomastia, or prevalent metastasis. The testicle is hard, stony, irregular, and not very sensitive. Tumor markers include alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). Biopsy is contraindicated; diagnosis is made by inguinal orchiectomy.

- **Inguinal or Inguino-scrotal Hernia:** A painless swelling of the groin fold, reducible when coughing.

- **Hydrocele:** Accumulation of intravaginal serous fluid between the testicle and its vaginal envelope. Presents as an enlarged, painless bursa. Positive transillumination confirms the diagnosis.

- **Cord Cyst:** Regular painless swelling, suspended above and independent of the testicle.

- **Varicocele:** Varicose dilation of the veins of the pampiniform plexus of the cord. May be discovered during examination, presenting as discomfort or heaviness, especially when standing. Inspection may reveal a deformity of the scrotum, which diminishes with decubitus. Palpation reveals a varicose swelling. Varicocele is common in young pubescent adolescents on the left side. A right-side varicocele or recent onset should be investigated with imaging.

== Cryptorchidism ==

Defined as a testicle located outside the scrotum, excluding oscillating or ascending testicles and ectopic testicles. Examination should be gentle, with warm hands, and the child lying supine. The inguino-scrotal region is palpated to locate the testicle. Clinical situations include unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism with palpable or non-palpable testicles. Endocrine investigation and karyotype should be performed for bilateral cryptorchidism with non-palpable testicles.

== Anomalies of the Penis ==

- **Phimosis:** Defined as a stenosis of the preputial orifice preventing complete retraction of the skin behind the glans. Pathological in adults.

- **Paraphimosis:** Complication of phimosis due to forced retraction of the preputial ring.

- **Penile Thickening:** Noticeable during erection, associated with hypospadias or fibrous plaques of the corpora cavernosa.

- **Cancer of the Penis:** Squamous cell cancer affecting adult men, associated with pre-cancerous lesions and HPV infections.

== Urethral Meatus Anomalies ==

- **Urethral Meatus Stenosis:** Often secondary to repair of an abnormal meatus or circumcision. May cause dysuria, chronic urinary retention, or urinary infections.

- **Hypospadias:** Urethral meatus located along the urethra, not at the apex of the glans. Associated with penile discoloration.

- **Epispadias:** Urethral meatus on the dorsal surface of the penis, associated with urinary continence disorders and erectile dysfunction.",0.9230769230769231,20.615714285714287,False,True,0.6726764440536499,0.6668604811032613,c,False,2,4

== Acute Complications of BPH Warrant Immediate Therapeutic Management ==

- **Acute Urinary Retention** must be suspected in the presence of hypogastric pain and an inability to micturate, along with the presence of a bladder globe on clinical examination. It requires urgent urine diversion through bladder catheterisation or suprapubic catheterisation. Alpha-blocker treatment should be started immediately. Failure to resume micturition after removal or clamping of the catheter warrants surgical management.

- **Urinary Tract Infection** may complicate BPH, presenting as acute prostatitis or orchi-epididymitis. It should be suspected with an exacerbation of SBAU, urinary burning, and fever. On examination, acute prostatitis presents with a painful rectum, while orchi-epididymitis shows as an inflamed and swollen area on examination of the external genitalia. Urinary infection is confirmed by ECBU and requires hospitalisation if poorly tolerated. Initial treatment involves a probabilistic antibiotic (quinolone), later adapted according to the antibiogram.

- **Macroscopic Haematuria** may complicate BPH. BPH can only be considered as a cause once other causes, such as urothelial carcinoma or kidney tumours, are ruled out. These should be investigated by uro CT scan and bladder fibroscopy. The presence of clots with urinary retention requires the insertion of a large-calibre dual-current bladder catheter for decalcification with lavage.

- **Acute Renal Failure** linked to the subvesical obstruction of BPH should be suspected with back pain, oedema, nausea, reduced diuresis, or anuria. Renal failure is confirmed by measuring creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate, and the cause is identified by renal-vesicoprostatic ultrasound.

**Understanding the Role of Coronary Angiography in the Diagnosis and Management of Acute Coronary Syndrome**

**Definitions**

**Coronary Angiography:**  
This procedure is used to identify the coronary lesion responsible and decide on its treatment, which may include angioplasty with a stent, coronary bypass surgery, or medical treatment alone. It is an invasive examination requiring pre-operative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure.

**Principles of ACS Management**

- **ST+ ACS:** The emergency is coronary unblocking.
  - Assessment of the time between the ECG (diagnosis of ST+) and arrival in the coronary angiography suite for placement of the angioplasty guide (start of angioplasty).
  - If delay ‚â§ 120 minutes, primary angioplasty is recommended.
  - If > 120 minutes, fibrinolysis is preferred (unless contraindicated, except for symptoms >12 hours) followed by salvage angioplasty in the absence of reperfusion or deferred within 24 hours if reperfusion occurs.
  - For ACS >12 hours after onset of pain: primary angioplasty remains indicated in cases of persistent pain, hemodynamic instability, or rhythmic instability (ventricular rhythm disorders). Angioplasty should be considered up to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms; beyond that, in the absence of chest pain, viability should first be sought in the infarcted territory.

- **Non-ST+ ACS:** Coronary angiography is generally performed within 24 hours, particularly if troponin is elevated. Note: In the special case of non-ST+ ACS refractory to medical treatment (patient still in pain), the patient must be taken urgently (<2 hours) to the coronary angiography suite.",0.7272727272727273,18.963333333333335,False,True,0.7946841716766357,0.7141916553179423,a,False,3,4

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis

The natural history of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) comprises three evolutionary phases:

- **Pre-dementia or prodromal phase:**
  - Onset of the symptomatic phase of the disease, most often revealed by memory complaints (forgetfulness as you go along).
  - Autonomy: Minor neurocognitive disorder (cf. item 132 Definition Neurocognitive disorder); autonomy is preserved for most instrumental activities of daily living (ability to use the telephone, use means of transport, manage medication, handle money). Progressive loss of autonomy (SDD-031).
  - Cognition: The neurocognitive disorder most often affects episodic memory; neuropsychological assessment shows a consolidation disorder in episodic memory. Memory disorders/cognitive decline (SD-131).

- **State or dementia phase (mild to moderate):**
  - Autonomy: Major neurocognitive disorder (cf. item 132 Definition Neurocognitive disorder); autonomy is significantly impaired for instrumental activities of daily living. Progressive loss of autonomy (SDD-031).
  - Cognition: The neurocognitive disorder is no longer centered on memory and now affects other cognitive functions: a syndrome known as ""aphaso-apraxo-agnosic"" and impairment of executive functions. Memory disorders/cognitive decline (SD-131).

- **Severe dementia phase:**
  - On average 7 to 8 years after the first symptoms of the disease are detected, preceding the end of life and often justifying institutionalization.
  - Autonomy: Major neurocognitive disorder (cf. item 132 Definition Neurocognitive disorder) with a loss of autonomy not only for instrumental activities but also for basic activities of daily living (toileting, dressing, locomotion, eating). Progressive loss of autonomy (SDD-031), urinary incontinence (SD-103).
  - Cognition: Even more pronounced neurocognitive problems, which can go as far as not being recognized by close relatives.
  - Psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia (cf. Item 132 Positive diagnosis Psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia): Possibly present to varying degrees at all stages of AD, they are very frequent at this stage: agitation or apathy, hallucinations, delusional disorders, wandering, sleep disorders, and appetite disorders.
  - Neurological and somatic disorders: Walking and posture disorders with falls, epilepsy, myoclonus, sphincter control disorders, and undernutrition.

Diagnosis is made by means of a ""Lipid Abnormality Investigation (LAI)"" on serum after 12 hours' fasting. It includes:  
- Appearance of the serum  
- Quantification of total cholesterol  
- Quantification of triglycerides  
- Quantification of HDL cholesterol  
- Estimation of LDL-cholesterol by calculation if triglycerides < 3.8 mmol/L (i.e., 3.4 g/L), otherwise by direct measurement  

== Primary Hyperlipidemia and Secondary Hyperlipidemia ==

A distinction is made between primary hyperlipidaemia, characterised by a primary abnormality of lipid metabolism, and secondary hyperlipidaemia.  

- **Primary Hyperlipidaemia:**
  - Pure hypercholesterolaemia: Isolated increase in LDL cholesterol
  - Pure hypertriglyceridaemia: Isolated (or highly preponderant) increase in triglycerides. Hypertriglyceridaemia is defined as fasting triglyceride levels > 1.7 mmol/L (i.e., 1.50 g/L)
  - Mixed hyperlipidaemia: Joint increase in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides  

- **Secondary Hyperlipidaemia:**  
  Includes the specific dyslipidaemia associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The latter includes an increase in triglycerides and a drop in HDL-cholesterol, and is associated with a high cardiovascular risk.

== Different Types of Pure Hypercholesterolaemia ==

- **Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (classified as IIa in the Fredrickson classification):**
  - Severe forms secondary to single gene mutations (LDL receptor, apoB, PCSK9), causing early cardiovascular events
  - Rare homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, characterised by extremely high LDL-cholesterol levels > 10 mmol/L (i.e., 4 g/L) and the occurrence of cardiovascular events in childhood
  - Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, characterised by very high LDL-cholesterol levels of between 5 and 10 mmol/L (i.e., 1.90 and 4 g/L) and the occurrence of early cardiovascular events (before the age of 50), in the absence of effective cholesterol-lowering treatment  

- **Polygenic Hypercholesterolaemia (classified as IIa in Fredrickson's classification):**  
  Frequent, onset during life, favoured by a poor lifestyle, moderately high LDL-cholesterol level often < 5.7 mmol/L (i.e., 2.20 g/L)

== Different Types of Pure Hypertriglyceridemia ==

- **Hyperchylomicronemia (or exogenous hypertriglyceridemia) (classified as I in Fredrickson's classification):**  
  Divided into familial hyperchylomicronemia and multifactorial hyperchylomicronemia. They are at high risk of acute pancreatitis.
  - Familial hyperchylomicronemias are rare and secondary to a genetic anomaly responsible for a deficiency in lipoprotein lipase activity (enzyme responsible for the breakdown of chylomicrons and VLDL)
  - Multifactorial hyperchylomicronemia is much more frequent than familial hyperchylomicronemia and is of multigenic origin associated with exposure to environmental factors  

- **Endogenous Hypertriglyceridaemia (classified as IV in the Fredrickson classification):**  
  Characterised by an excess of VLDL  

- **Pure Hypertriglyceridaemia:**  
  Marked by a high risk of acute pancreatitis, when triglyceride values exceed 11 mmol/L (i.e., 10 g/L)

== Different Types of Mixed Hyperlipidaemia ==

- **Dysbetalipoproteinemia (classified III in the Fredrickson classification):**  
  Rare, characterized by a harmonious elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides  

- **Familial Combined Hyperlipidaemia:**  
  Fairly frequent, characterised by variability in lipid phenotypes (classically a joint increase in LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides [classified as IIb in Fredrickson's classification], sometimes an isolated increase in LDL-cholesterol [classified as IIa in Fredrickson's classification] or triglycerides [classified as IV in Fredrickson's classification]) within a family and in the same patient, and a high risk of cardiovascular events.",1.0,17.81,False,True,0.6903762817382812,0.8013226985931396,a,False,2,4

**Rubric:** Epidemiology

Elderly patients should be aware of the risk of iatrogenic side effects, particularly from psychotropic drugs. Polymedication exposes patients to the risk of drug interactions.

For mood disorders, risk factors are more marked in the elderly: non-psychiatric co-morbidities, loss of autonomy, and stressful psycho-social events. Progress depends in part on the therapeutic strategy. The risk of suicide is high, and the number of completed suicides is higher than in younger patients.

There is a frequent association with non-psychiatric pathologies, either by increasing the risk of developing a depressive episode characterized by certain pathologies (dementia, cardiovascular pathologies, sensory impairment, cancer) or by the fact that a depressive episode increases the risk of occurrence or aggravation of certain non-psychiatric pathologies (cognitive impairment, or even progression to Alzheimer's disease or related illnesses, diabetes, coronary artery disease).

Serotonergic antidepressants are the first-line treatment. For bipolar disorder, thymoregulators are the mainstay of treatment.

For psychotic disorders, second-generation antipsychotics should be used as first-line treatment. Treatment is identical to that for adults.

For Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), management must be comprehensive, with priority given to non-drug approaches. A non-psychiatric, iatrogenic, or psychiatric cause must be ruled out. Drug strategies are reserved for severe BPSD.

**Title:** Recognizing and Assessing Acute and Chronic Pain in Adults

**Description:** Know the tools and scales for assessing pain in communicating and non-communicating adults, including the principle of hetero-assessment scales.

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

**Interviewing and Assessing Pain**

- Diagnosis and assessment of pain intensity using a validated self-assessment scale (EVA, EN, EVS) must be actively undertaken by caregivers without waiting for a complaint. It is compulsory and must be recorded in the patient's file, regardless of the reason for hospitalization.

- This is essential for initiating treatment and can be performed by any healthcare professional, including medical students, doctors, psychologists, physiotherapists, nurses, midwives, dentists, and pharmacists.

**Objectives**

- Screening and diagnosing the nature of the patient's pain (acute or chronic, neuropathic, nociceptive, nociplastic, visceral, mixed).

- Evaluate the location of the pain, whether it is diffuse or focal, radiating, its characteristics (type of pain, factors reducing or increasing the pain, etc.), associated symptoms, and clinical signs (nausea, vomiting, fever, redness on inspection, tenderness on palpation of the abdomen, etc.).

- Assess the intensity of the pain by encouraging the patient to self-assess using validated scales (EN 0-10 oral or visual and VAS: pain intensity mild if <4, moderate between 4 and 6, severe if >6, EVS in 5 descriptors).

- Evaluate the efficacy, tolerance, and compliance with analgesic treatment, whether medicinal or not.

- The specific objectives of the interview and assessment differ depending on whether the pain is acute or chronic.

- In the case of acute pain (often nociceptive, traumatic, or post-operative), the therapeutic objective is curative, and etiological treatment is possible. Assessment is generally limited to the pain area, pain intensity (rest, effort), consumption of analgesics, and sometimes associated anxiety.

- In the case of chronic pain (a ""multi-dimensional"" entity with sensory, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral components), the objectives are symptomatic, and etiological treatment is rarely possible (HAS 1999 recommendations). Assessment takes time and can be spread over several consultations.

- It involves an etiological assessment with an interview, a clinical examination, and, if necessary, additional tests.

**Pain Assessment Tools and Scales for Communicating and Non-Communicating Adults**

**General Principles**

- Always use the same scale for the same patient unless there are changes in cognitive ability.

- If the patient has several painful sites, each pain must be assessed separately.

**Self-Assessment Scales for Pain and Its Impact**

- Aimed at communicating patients, i.e., children over the age of 6 or adults able to communicate verbally (no major cognitive disorders or disorders of consciousness).

- They mainly comprise ""pain intensity scales"" and ""multidimensional scales.""

- Intensity scales can be used to assess the intensity of pain at the present time or over the last 24 hours and, if necessary, to identify the 'emergency' to be treated, the level of painkillers to be used, the evolution of the pain, and the patient's level of relief.

- Multidimensional scales take into account different aspects of chronic pain and its repercussions. The most widely used is the McGill Pain Questionnaire, which explores the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. These scales should only be used in the management of chronic pain.

- The assessment of chronic pain can be supplemented by scales for depression, anxiety, quality of life, and sleep, which are not specific to pain. The most widely used scale is the Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), which assesses the anxiety and/or depression component in chronic pain patients.

**Pain Intensity Scales**

- **L'√âchelle Visuelle Analogique (EVA):** A 100 mm ruler, horizontal (adult) or vertical (child), with one end corresponding to ""no pain"" and the other to ""maximum imaginable pain."" The patient moves a cursor to indicate pain intensity, which is measured by the caregiver.

- **The Numerical Scale (EN):** Provides a numerical scoring system from 0 to 10. Visual support can help in critical situations or with less cooperative patients.

- **The Simple Verbal Scale (EVS):** Aimed at patients unable to use the previous scales. Includes qualifiers such as no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, very severe pain.

**Pain Hetero-Assessment Scales**

- Aimed at patients with verbal communication disorders. Clinicians observe the patient's pain behavior and quantify it using a validated score, known as behavioral scales. Each population (young children, post-operative young children, non-communicative elderly people, confused or sedated adult patients) has its own validated behavioral scales.

- Common areas of behavioral observation include facial expression (mimicry, grimace), vocalization or verbalization of pain, hypertonia and movement of the limbs, agitation or absence of movement, and interruption of usual activities.

- Each hetero-evaluation scale has a threshold score associated with significant pain intensity, prompting clinicians to consider the cause of the pain and its treatment.",1.0,15.440869565217394,False,True,0.7701195478439331,0.6116400162378947,a,False,4,3

Depending on the type of function affected, it is possible to establish an approximate topography of the regions affected (topographical diagnosis), which contributes to the diagnosis of the underlying neurocognitive disorder (aetiological diagnosis).

**Definitions**

**Attention**

- Depends on cortical alertness and arousal systems: there is a continuum between ""Attention Disorder (SDD-129),"" ""Mental Confusion/Disorientation (SD-119)"" (which result from severe ""Attention Disorder (SDD-129)""), and ""Coma and Consciousness Disorder (SDD-028).""

- Attention is necessary for all major intellectual functions: the degree of attentional impairment must be checked before exploring or interpreting a cognitive disorder.

- Tests include repeating a long sentence, carrying out complex instructions, and giving the months of the year or days of the week backwards.

**Perceptual Integration Functions**

- Carried by the posterior cortical regions, these are the functions of identification, recognition, and comprehension of language, gestures, space, sound or visual objects, and the body schema.

- They are located downstream of the perceptual functions (auditory cortex in the temporal lobe, visual cortex in the occipital lobe) and essentially result from damage to the temporal and parietal lobes.

- **Temporal Lobe Involvement:**

  - Aphasia (""Language and/or phonation disorders (SD-134)"") by impairment of comprehension, visual agnosia (failure to identify and represent simple visual objects like colors or shapes or more complex ones like faces, manufactured or living objects).

  - Tests understanding of simple commands (""close your eyes""), naming of objects or faces.

- **Parietal Lobe Involvement:**

  - Apraxia (failure to perform movements in the absence of a deficit in sensitivity or basic motor skills), visual neglect unilateral, i.e., inattention to the contralateral visual field (in the absence of an amputation of the visual field), disturbance of the representation of the body schema (difficulty in naming body parts, indistinctness between the left and right sides, etc.).

  - Tested by copying a geometric figure, drawing a flower or house without copying, clock test, imitating arbitrary gestures, symbolic gestures (""military salute"", ""nose-thumbing""), and gestures involving the use of objects (""brushing teeth"", ""combing hair"", ""playing the violin"", ""hammering a nail"").

**Memory**

- Corresponds to several very distinct systems (episodic, semantic, procedural memory, etc.), but in the tests, episodic memory is mainly assessed.

- **Episodic Memory:**

  - The ability to transform an event experienced by oneself into a lasting memory and to retrieve it at a later date; its formation and retrieval are always associated with the context of the event experienced (i.e., the place, the moment, the emotional state).

  - The critical phase of recording information in memory (also known as storage or ""consolidation"").

  - Depends on the medial part of the temporal lobes (T5), in particular the hippocampi and adjacent cortices.

  - Damage to both hippocampi results in anterograde amnesia, leading to ""progressive forgetting"" (""What did I do two minutes ago, an hour ago, the day before, a week ago?"").

- Five-word test: very useful for determining whether memory damage affects consolidation or not.

  - 1. Read five words (""Museum"", ""Lemonade"", ""Colander"", ""Grasshopper"", and ""Truck"") aloud and then have them read a second time, starting by asking the taxonomic category of the word (""What is the drink?""...).

  - 2. Immediately afterwards, have the pupils repeat the five words (immediate recall).

  - 3. After an interval of 3 minutes (busy with another non-verbal task, e.g., a drawing task), ask for the five words again. If the patient cannot recall the words, he is given the taxonomic category of the word. If the index does not allow the words to be recalled, this is probably a consolidation disorder.

**Executive Functions**

- Mental operations enabling the individual to understand the context of the action, to inhibit automatic or reflexive behavior, and to generate voluntary behavior directed towards a goal.

- Depend on a vast cerebral network, but the most critical regions are the frontal lobes and basal ganglia.

- Dysexecutive syndrome leads to a lack of contextualization (difficulty in social adaptation, loss of empathy, impaired judgment and reasoning), a release of automatic behaviors (repetitive and stereotyped obsessive disorders, compulsive behavior) and reflexive or archaic in dependence on the immediate environment (urinary control disorder, adherence to the environment, rush to food, eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia, disinhibition, etc.) and a failure to develop and initiate voluntary action (lack of planning, apathy).

- Tested using the rapid frontal efficiency battery (BREF).",0.8571428571428571,20.540689655172418,False,True,0.6764976978302002,0.5822637478510538,d,False,5,2

=Identify a Medication Error, Its Mechanisms, and Know the Consequences=

==Definition==
According to the French National Authority for Health, a medicinal product error is defined as any preventable event that could cause or lead to the inappropriate use of a medicinal product or harm to the patient when the medicinal product is under the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or user. This is an unintentional act involving the medicinal product during the care process. A medicinal product error is said to have occurred when the error has been confirmed, and a ""near miss"" or potential error when the error has been identified and avoided in time.

==Mechanisms==
A medication error may be linked to professional practice, healthcare products, procedures, and systems covering the entire medication circuit: prescribing, communication of the prescription, dispensing, preparation, distribution, administration, education, therapeutic monitoring/follow-up, and use. Causes directly related to the product may also be found, linked to the labeling, packaging, or nomenclature of the product.

==Characterization of an Error==
- Its classification: ""error, potential error, or risk of error.""
- Its stage: prescribing, dispensing, preparation, administration, therapeutic follow-up, etc.
- The nature of the error: drug, dose, dosage/concentration, route of administration, flow rate, administration technique, patient, time of administration, duration of administration, omission, etc.
- Their causes: communication problems, human factors, name confusion, labeling and/or information problems, packaging or design problems, etc.

==Consequences==
A medication error can result in:
- An adverse event resulting in harm to the patient
- A near miss in which the patient almost suffered harm
- No harm or risk of harm",0.42857142857142855,13.251764705882355,False,True,0.827126145362854,0.7604449590047201,b,False,2,4

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Definitions**

The photomotor reflex (PMR) is the pupillary constriction that occurs when one eye is illuminated.

- The afferent pathway of the PMR travels with the optic pathways: it begins at the retinal photoreceptors stimulated by light. The pupillomotor fibers travel along the optic nerves to the chiasma, where they undergo hemidecussation, and then along the optic bands to the external geniculate bodies. They do not follow the optic radiations but reach the two nuclei of the Ill.

- The parasympathetic efferent pathway of the PMR follows the Ill pathway and ends at the sphincter of the iris.

In a normal subject, when one eye is illuminated, there is a reflex myosis on the same side: this is the direct PMR. Due to the hemidecussation of the pupillomotor fibers at the chiasma, there is also myosis of the opposite eye via the contralateral Ill: this is the consensual PMR.

**Sensory Mydriasis Secondary to Severe Visual Impairment**  
(e.g., occlusion of the central retinal artery, optic neuropathy):

- When the affected eye is illuminated, the afferent pathway of the PMR is ""suppressed"" due to the drop in vision. The direct PMR is abolished, as is the consensual PMR.
- With illumination of the other eye, the afferent pathway is normal in this eye and the efferent pathway is normal in both eyes, so the PMR is preserved in both eyes.

**Paralytic Mydriasis**  
(Mydriasis caused by Ill's paralysis):

- **Conventional Radiography of the Affected Area**  
  - Easy access  
  - Assessment of bone and joint injuries  
  - Initial radiographs may be normal; abnormalities can be delayed compared to the onset of infection (2-3 weeks in adults, 8-10 days in children): osteolysis, periosteal appositions, Brodie's abscess, etc.  
  - Broad indication: almost systematic (except for spondylodiscitis) at diagnosis, then according to progress.  
  - Systematic in emergencies in children (eliminates fracture, tumour, etc.)

- **Ultrasound**  
  - Easy to access  
  - Joint and soft tissue assessment  
  - Septic arthritis (not systematic): confirmation of effusion if there is clinical doubt (particularly in the hip), guidance for puncture if necessary.  
  - Acute osteomyelitis in children: look for soft tissue abscess, subperiosteal abscess (in case of severe pain)

- **CT Scan Without and With Injection of Contrast Medium**  
  - Assessment of bone and joint lesions  
  - Delayed signs  
  - Bone structure and stability  
  - Chronic osteitis: initial assessment  
  - Spondylodiscitis: initial assessment coupled with functional imaging (only if MRI is contraindicated), assessment of spinal deformity at a distance.  
  - Arthritis: rarely useful

- **MRI**  
  - Early signs (a few days)  
  - Best test for diagnosing inflammatory osteoarticular disease  
  - Assessment of soft tissue and neurological structures (spondylodiscitis)  
  - Spondylodiscitis: reference diagnostic examination, search for complications (paravertebral abscess, spinal cord or radicular compression).  
  - Acute osteomyelitis in children: diagnostic confirmation (shows bone oedema with T1 hyposignal and T2 hypersignal), search for complications (subperiosteal or soft tissue abscesses, arthritis, associated venous thrombosis).  
  - Chronic osteitis: not systematic, extent of initial bone involvement  
  - Arthritis: rarely useful

- **Functional Imaging**  
  - Early but non-specific abnormalities  
  - Modalities: bone or marked polynuclear scintigraphy, PET scan, etc.  
  - Not systematic  
  - Spondylodiscitis: 18FDG PET scans, if MRI is contraindicated.  
  - Acute osteomyelitis in children: Technetium-99m bone scintigraphy as an alternative to MRI, especially useful for young children in whom MRI is difficult to perform (need for sedation) or in cases of clinical difficulty in locating the infection.

The main diagnostic difficulty lies in the ""haemorrhoid offence"": sufferers and the practitioners concerned attribute any proctological complaint a priori to haemorrhoids, whereas these non-specific complaints may be related to suppuration, an anal fissure, or cancer. This highlights the need for a detailed semiological approach and a good clinical examination.

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Definitions**  

**Essential Trigeminal Neuralgia (Classic or Idiopathic)**  

- **Pain:** Very intense, searing, lightning-like or electric discharge, of very short duration (a few seconds). The patient briefly stands still in a painful attitude.  

- **Topography:** Unilateral and strictly localized:  
  - In the trigeminal area (but not beyond).  
  - Single-branch (maxillary V2: 40%, maxillary V3: 20%, ophthalmic V1: 10%); or double-branch.  

- **Triggering Factors:** Pain triggered electively by excitation of a specific area of skin in the painful territory, the trigger zone. A light touch is enough. Attacks can be triggered by speech, mimicry, laughter, or chewing, so the patient tries to keep a still face and eat as little as possible.  

- **Clinical Examination:**  
  - Normal in classical and idiopathic neuralgia: facial and corneal sensitivity (corneal reflex present), strength of masticatory muscles (innervated by the V motor) normal, absence of any neurological damage, normal skin.  
  - The presence of the slightest abnormality (hypoesthesia, motor damage to the V3 branch) points to ""secondary neuralgia"".  

**Trigeminal Neuralgia or Secondary Trigeminal Neuropathic Pain**  

- When pain is localized to the V territory, the aim is to rule out secondary neuralgia (due to a cause other than a vascular-nervous impingement) or secondary painful neuropathy.  

- **Secondary Neuralgia:** Pain in the form of an electric discharge, with a trigger zone. Sometimes the clinical examination is strictly normal, which is why an MRI scan is necessary for any trigeminal neuralgia.  

- **Secondary Trigeminal Neuropathic Pain:** The pain is of the continuous burning type, sometimes with additional discharges.  

- **Red Flags:** A secondary cause must be evoked when:  
  - A young age of onset (MS).  
  - Less intense discharges (painful neuropathy).  
  - A preponderance in the V1 territory (shingles?).  
  - A painful background with paresthesia and hypoesthesia (painful neuropathy).  
  - Clinical abnormality: hypoesthesia, reduced corneal reflex, V3 motor damage (masseter, pterygoid) and/or damage to other cranial nerves on the same side.  

- **Investigations:** A cerebral MRI with thin sections of the brainstem and trigeminal nerve along its entire course (with gadolinium injection) is imperative, along with a biological work-up and sometimes a lumbar puncture.",0.75,13.673333333333336,False,True,0.791511058807373,0.694547692934672,b,False,4,4

- According to an Inca survey conducted for the second cancer plan in 2010, 53% of patients with all types and stages of cancer report experiencing pain, with 28% considering their pain severe.
- Among those with advanced cancer, 62% appear to be under-treated. Pain persists in 14% of patients in remission.

**Mechanisms of Pain in Cancer Patients**

Cancer pain is caused by several mechanisms: nociceptive, neuropathic, mixed (neuropathic and nociceptive), and nociplastic.

**Classification of Cancer Pain**

Cancer-related pain can be acute or chronic:
- Related to the tumor: Pain can be nociceptive or neuropathic (due to radicular compression, epiduritis, plexus invasion).
- Related to cancer treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy): This is often neuropathic pain.

**Types of Pain According to Duration and Evolution**

- Often continuous background pain
- Paroxysmal pain such as throbbing, stabbing, or electric shocks, or an increase in continuous pain.
- Paroxysmal pain attacks (PPA) or ""breakthrough pain"": Brief, intense pain attacks, occurring without connection to the dose or rate of background treatment, often in the context of bone metastases. The paroxysm is reached in less than 3 minutes. In half the cases, the pain lasts for more than 30 minutes. ADP must be distinguished from pain attacks occurring at the end of a morphine dose.

**Objectives and Therapeutic Principles of Cancer Pain**

The objectives of adequate analgesic treatment for cancer pain are:
- No or low-intensity background pain
- Respect for sleep
- Fewer than 4 painful attacks per day with treatment efficacy > 50%
- Normal activities, although limited by cancer progression, are still possible
- Minor or no adverse effects of treatment

**Specific Features of Cancer Pain Treatments**

- For nociceptive pain, treatment is based on WHO levels using Level I, II, and III analgesics: Level I for mild to moderate pain, Level II for moderate to severe pain, and Level III (strong opiates) for severe pain.
- For neuropathic pain, or mixed pain, treatments include gabapentin, duloxetine, tricyclics, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and local anesthetic plasters.
- Intramedullary analgesic treatments and peri-nervous blocks are indicated for bone pain or pain refractory to previous treatments, especially if high doses of strong systemic opiates are required.
- Psychological treatment by a qualified professional is recommended in all cases.
- Complementary pain relief techniques can be added to previous treatments.
- Surgery, cementoplasty, vertebroplasty, radiotherapy, and bisphosphonates may be offered specifically for bone pain.
- If high doses of systemic morphine are used, consider the implantation of a reservoir pump and an intrathecal catheter.
- Radiotherapy is sometimes considered for pain relief (stereotactic radiotherapy in particular).

**Treatment of Pain in Cancer According to Its Mechanisms**

- **Excess Nociception**: Level I, II, III analgesics
- **Neuropathic**: Tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs (e.g., duloxetine), gabapentin, pregabalin, topical anesthetics
- **Bone Pain (tumor or metastases)**: Tier I, II, or III analgesics, radiotherapy, nerve blocks, bisphosphonates, NSAIDs, surgery, cementoplasty/vertebroplasty
- **Soft Tissue Infiltration**: Tier I, II, or III analgesics, NSAIDs, corticosteroids
- **Lymphoedema**: Gentle massage, raising, compression stockings, corticosteroids

**Title:** Appreciate the risks associated with counterfeit medicines

**Description:** None

== General ==

The ingestion of unknown and/or dangerous products can lead to health problems that threaten the lives of thousands of people, creating new types of health crises. These risks are greater for developing countries, which have the least protection against trafficking in health products. Only risks related to public health are detailed here (thus excluding risks related to the economy, innovation, the environment, employment, etc.).

== Quantity-related Risks ==

=== No Active Ingredient ===

Products containing no active ingredient fail to cure patients, divert them from effective therapies, and delay the proper management of sometimes urgent situations. These products can be just as dangerous or even fatal as fake medicines containing poisons or unauthorized products. 

Example: In 2012, in the United States, an anti-cancer drug Avastin¬Æ containing no active ingredients was found in 19 doctors' surgeries.

=== Insufficient Quantity of Active Ingredient ===

Underdosed drugs cannot be effective. Long-term use of an under-dosed counterfeit product can also lead to drug resistance, particularly in the case of antibiotics or antiparasitic drugs (anti-malaria, anti-HIV, or anti-tuberculosis treatments). This resistance, acquired during long-term use, can prevent the effectiveness of therapies against disease, creating an additional risk for public health. 

In 2009, in Tanzania, a Metakelfin¬Æ antimalarial treatment containing insufficient active ingredient was discovered in 40 pharmacies across the country.

=== Excessive Quantity of Active Ingredient ===

In such cases, there is a risk that the patient will overdose and suffer adverse effects. 

Example: In 2009, in China, hypoglycemic drugs containing 6 times the normal dose of glibenclamide led to the death of 2 patients and 9 others were hospitalized.

== Risks Associated with the Composition of Counterfeit Products ==

In some cases, the active ingredient may be replaced by corn starch, potato starch, or saline solution. Sometimes it is the presence of toxic substances that is found, which can be very serious for the patient, even leading to death. These are described below:

- **Heavy Metals:** Mercury, lead, arsenic, aluminum, etc. These products are carcinogenic and toxic to the central nervous system, kidneys, and liver.
- **Real Poisons:** Rat poison, boric acid, antifreeze, etc. Toxic to the kidneys, causing kidney failure and developmental abnormalities. Example: In Haiti (1995) and India (1998), a cough syrup containing paracetamol was prepared with diethylene glycol (a toxic chemical used as antifreeze) and caused a total of 89 deaths in both countries.
- **Common Household Products:** Brick dust, chalk, paints, floor wax, etc. Used to improve the appearance of counterfeit medicines, they cause a wide range of adverse effects, from vomiting and dizziness to coma and even death.
- **Other and Unwanted Active Ingredients:** Sibutramine, haloperidol, etc. All carry risks of varying degrees depending on their activity and dosage, such as breathing difficulties, muscle spasms, high blood pressure, strokes, etc. Example: Between 2000 and 2003, in the United States, aspirin was substituted for tablets of a neuroleptic (Zyprexa¬Æ).",0.7142857142857143,14.64,False,True,0.8321119546890259,0.6518165071805319,d,False,4,4

- In the first stage, development is intra-epithelial, without crossing the basement membrane. These lesions are called ""in situ"" cancers (or carcinomas). ""In situ"" cancers (ductal or lobular) are characterized by their lack of metastatic potential.
- When the carcinoma becomes invasive, meaning it crosses the basement membrane, the cells can spread either by lymphatic or hematogenous route or by contiguity.
- Lymphatic drainage of the breast occurs at three main sites: the lymph nodes of the axillary fossa (the most important), the supra- and sub-clavicular nodes, and the nodes of the internal mammary chain.

Four areas: 1) hygiene care, 2) local anti-inflammatory treatment, 3) emollients, 4) therapeutic education.

### 1) Non-aggressive hygiene care for cleansing and avoidance of aggravating factors:
- Use a mild, unscented soap-free gel instead of soap.
- Reduce the frequency of washing skin (once every 2 days or once a day).
- Avoid prolonged hot baths.
- Apply an emollient after washing on non-inflammatory skin.
- Favor soft textiles and avoid wool.
- Do not overheat the home and avoid over-covering children, as home heating may aggravate the condition.

### 2) Local anti-inflammatory treatment: Dermocorticoids
Dermocorticoids (DC) have anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and antimitotic actions. They are effective in the short term against atopic dermatitis (AD) flare-ups, though long-term efficacy studies are rare. DCs are classified by potency (very strong, strong, moderate, weak) and form (cream, ointment, lotion, gel).

**Choice of DC depends on four criteria:** age, location of lesions, extent to be treated, and oozing nature of lesions.

**Choice of galenical:**
- Ointment for dry, lichenified skin areas.
- Cream for oozing areas, folds, and large skin surfaces.
- Lotion for hairy areas and folds (rarely used on children).
- Scalp gel (rarely used in children).

**Choice of activity level:**
- Very strong DCs are contraindicated for infants, young children, and on the face, folds, and seat.
- High-activity DCs in short courses (4 to 7 days) are indicated for children on lichenified lesions, extremities, and lesions resistant to moderate-activity DCs.
- Moderate-activity DCs are used on the face and body of infants and children.
- Low-activity DCs are not recommended due to low efficacy.

**Number of applications per day:**
A single application per day is as effective as multiple applications and aids treatment adherence.

**Quantity to be applied:**
No maximum quantity is recommended during initial treatment. Maintenance treatment should not exceed 30 g/month of moderate-activity DC for children and 60 g/month for adults. Using a strong dermocorticoid twice a week on usually affected areas for 4 months can reduce flare-ups without side effects, suitable for chronic AD with frequent flare-ups.

### 3) Emollients
Emollients improve skin dryness and temporarily restore the skin's barrier function. Their use is recommended from the first symptoms of skin dryness and as maintenance treatment throughout AD, regardless of severity.

**Precautions for use:**
- Interrupt use during highly inflammatory flare-ups due to poor tolerance.
- Adapt galenics to patient preferences.
- Use fragrance-free and preservative-free products to avoid contact sensitization. Note: Emollients are not reimbursed by health insurance, except for atopiclair¬Æ, generics of dexeryl¬© (reimbursable at 15%), and magistral preparations reimbursed in the absence of an available equivalent.

### 4) Therapeutic education
The aim is to teach patients to live optimally with a chronic disease. It involves providing information and learning techniques by healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, psychologists) through consultations and/or small group meetings. The goal is to help patients and families become more independent, adhere to treatment, and combat corticophobia.

**Other treatments:**
- Oral antihistamines (anti-H1): No proven efficacy on pruritus in the acute phase, except for hydroxyzine, a sedative anti-H1, during flare-ups in young children with sleep disorders.
- Topical immunomodulator: Tacrolimus (in France) is indicated for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis flare-ups in children and adults where dermocorticoids are resistant or contraindicated (especially facial lesions).

Any abnormal uterine bleeding (SUA) in a post-menopausal woman should rule out endometrial cancer.

SUA is an infrequent occurrence (less than 15%) with HRT and is sometimes linked to overdose or the resumption of ovarian activity at the start of treatment, but it should be ruled out as a cause of endometrial cancer.

In the case of recurrent abnormal uterine bleeding or when the thickness of the endometrium is greater than 4 mm, additional uterine explorations (hysteroscopy and histology) are necessary.

=== What to Do ===

- Look for risk factors for endometrial cancer on the questionnaire:
  - Obesity
  - Hypertension
  - Type 2 diabetes
  - Taking HRT
  - Tamoxifen treatment
  - Family history

- Conduct a clinical examination to rule out a vaginal or cervical cause.

- Carry out an endometrial biopsy using the Cornier pipelle, bearing in mind that it is only of value if it is positive.

- Perform a pelvic ultrasound to measure the thickness of the endometrium.

**Description:** Know the procedures for antenatal screening for trisomy 21

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis

Doctors must inform patients of the possibility of prenatal screening for trisomy 21 (SD-307), which is covered by the health insurance scheme but is not compulsory.

Screening includes a combined 1st trimester test based on:

- Maternal age
- Nuchal translucency measurement in the 1st trimester
- Measurement of serum markers in the 1st trimester (PAPP-A, free beta-HCG)

The course of action varies according to the result of the combined test:

- If the risk is less than 1/1000, simple pregnancy monitoring is recommended.
- If the risk is between 1/51 and 1/1000, non-invasive prenatal screening is proposed (test on free foetal DNA circulating in maternal blood, DPNI):
  - If the DPNI is negative: continuation of the usual ultrasound monitoring of the pregnancy.
  - If the DPNI is positive: proposal of a foetal karyotype. The FISH test has a very good positive and negative predictive value, but does not allow a definite diagnosis of trisomy 21 to be made. Therefore, no termination of pregnancy will be carried out on the basis of a positive result from an NIPD test.
- If the risk is greater than or equal to 1/50, a foetal karyotype is proposed straight away. However, the woman may ask to undergo an INFP.

If it has not been possible to carry out screening in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, it is possible to propose the measurement of serum markers in the 2nd trimester (hCG, alpha-feto-protein, oestriol).",0.6153846153846154,12.875652173913043,False,True,0.7842456102371216,0.7040550708770752,b,False,2,5

**Description:** Loss of neurons, accumulation of amyloid protein, accumulation of tau protein

**Rubric:** Pathophysiological elements

Like the vast majority of neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by an accumulation of proteins (known as proteinopathy) associated with cell loss. In the case of AD, this includes:

- The accumulation of Œ≤-amyloid peptide (AŒ≤-42) in extracellular deposits forming ""amyloid plaques"" or ""senile plaques."" A peptide is a protein fragment; in this case, the parent protein is Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). The plaques are mainly present in the associative cerebral cortices (prefrontal, parietal, and temporal cortices) and relatively spare the primary visual cortex (occipital lobes) and the motor cortex (precentral gyrus).

- Abnormal accumulation in the body and neuronal extensions of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein forming neurofibrillary degeneration (NFD); these NFDs are found in large quantities in the medial temporal regions, particularly the hippocampi.

- Loss of neurons affected by TDR. When this cell loss is massive, it leads to atrophy of the affected regions.

Knowledge of these elements of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology enables an understanding of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SD-183) and MRI semiology (cf. item 343 Know the indications and objectives of imaging in the presence of dementia or confusion; cf. item 132 Positive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease).",0.875,17.2,False,True,0.7786729335784912,0.6761288046836853,c,True,5,2

The macrovascular damage caused by diabetes is concentrated in the heart (risk of coronary heart disease X2 to 4) and the large vessels (risk of OIA X5 and risk of stroke X2).

The pathophysiology shares many similarities with non-diabetic atheroma, although a few clinical differences can be identified in diabetic patients: onset at an earlier age, lesions that are often more extensive and less symptomatic (less neuropathy-related pain).

Follow-up studies have shown that the risk factors for macrovascular disease in T2DM patients, after adjustment for age and sex, are as follows:

1. Glycaemic control (HbA1c)
2. Lipid balance (especially LDL, but also low HDL) ""Lipid analysis (SD-195)""

Contamination of the fetus is transplacental, and the rubella virus is teratogenic.

The risk of fetal infection varies with gestational age. Before 11 weeks' gestation, the incidence of fetal infection is around 90%. This frequency decreases to 25% between 24 and 26 weeks' gestation, then increases again to reach 100% at the end of the pregnancy. If conception occurs after the rash, the risk of fetal infection is likely low, as the rash coincides with the appearance of antibodies and the end of viremia. When maternal infection occurs before 11 weeks' gestation, the risk of major fetal anomalies is very high (around 90%). After 18 weeks' gestation, the risk is virtually nil. Between 11 and 18 weeks' gestation, the frequency of abnormalities varies.

## Clinical Presentations

There are two situations:

- **Polymalformative syndrome**: This includes neurological anomalies (microcephaly), ophthalmic anomalies (cataracts, microphthalmia, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy, chorioretinitis), auditory anomalies (sensorineural deafness), and cardiac anomalies (stenosis of the peripheral pulmonary artery, persistence of the ductus arteriosus, or interventricular communication). It can be complicated by miscarriage or fetal death in utero.

- **Progressive congenital rubella**: This corresponds to chronic generalized viral infection, reflecting the persistence of the virus in the blood, which may persist for several months. These newborns are highly contagious. This form may be asymptomatic, particularly in the case of maternal infection after 18 weeks' gestation. When symptomatic, growth retardation, thrombocytopenic purpura, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, convulsions, and radiological bone abnormalities may be observed. These multi-visceral lesions may regress or leave sequelae. The long-term prognosis for congenital rubella that is symptomatic at birth is guarded, especially regarding psychomotor and auditory development.

## WHO Definitions

The WHO defines congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and congenital rubella infection (CRI) as follows:

- A case of **CRS** is a child with two complications from group A (cataract and/or congenital glaucoma, congenital heart disease, sensorineural deafness, pigmentary retinopathy) or one from group A plus one from group B (purpura, splenomegaly, microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, meningoencephalitis, bone mineralization anomalies, early neonatal jaundice). The diagnosis can be confirmed by testing for specific IgM antibodies in the neonatal period.

- A case of **CRI** is a child who does not fit into the previous definition and who has positive specific IgM in the neonatal period.",0.6666666666666666,13.945882352941176,False,True,0.8704752922058105,0.8229219317436218,c,False,1,5

**Title:** Knowing the Three Main Protective Measures  
**Description:** Understand situations that can lead to legal protection measures, curatorship, and guardianship.

Illness, disability, or accident can alter a person's intellectual or physical faculties, preventing them from expressing their wishes and defending their interests alone. This person may be placed under a legal protection measure, which involves appointing another person to assist or represent them in their interests.

There are several forms of personal protection, the three main ones being legal protection, curatorship, and guardianship.

**1) Safeguard of Justice:**

Safeguard of justice is a temporary protective measure with limited effects, used to address an emergency situation where a person of legal age is at risk of taking action contrary to their interests. It is implemented pending either the person's recovery or the pronouncement of a curatorship or guardianship measure.

In its form, the safeguard of justice can be:

- **Medical:** Resulting from a statement made by a doctor (either the doctor of the person to be protected or the doctor of the health establishment where the person is) to the public prosecutor.
- **Judicial:** Requested by the guardianship judge, particularly if an application is made to the judge to place the person under guardianship or curatorship.

The person under court protection retains the capacity to perform all acts, but certain important acts (e.g., the sale of a property) may be specially entrusted to a proxy.

**2) Guardianship and Curatorship:**

The difference between guardianship and curatorship lies in the degree of constraint imposed by these measures. The consequences of establishing guardianship are greater than those of curatorship.

- **Guardianship:** A person placed under guardianship remains autonomous in everyday life but must be accompanied by a guardian for important acts. The guardianship judge defines the actions that the person may or may not take on their own, depending on their condition. Guardianship is a more protective measure. A guardian represents the adult to be protected in everyday life. The guardianship judge determines which acts the protected person may or may not perform alone.

There are three types of acts defined by law:
- Acts that the protected person can carry out themselves (e.g., shopping).
- Acts that require the guardian's authorization (e.g., renewing an identity card).
- Acts that require the guardianship judge's authorization (e.g., changing residence).

The duration of the protective measure is determined by the guardianship judge. If the protected person's condition does not seem likely to improve, the guardianship judge may decide to renew the guardianship.

**3) Protection of Minors:**

Guardianship of a minor is a legal protection measure whereby another person helps to protect the minor's interests when the holders of parental authority can no longer exercise them. In this case, the judge appoints a family council, which appoints a guardian and a subrogated guardian (a person appointed by the family council to represent the protected person when the latter's interests conflict with those of the guardian. This person has an obligation to monitor the management of the guardian).

To find out about the main implications of these protective measures, particularly regarding the rights of protected patients of full age, please refer to the previous knowledge objective (OIC-009-10-B Principles and Purposes of Personal Protection Measures).

The diagnosis of pneumothorax is made on an inspiratory radiograph of the thorax in the upright position, and the mediastinal impact is clarified. Radiographic diagnosis is more difficult in a supine patient. Exhalation X-rays are not recommended as they may increase the size of the pneumothorax.

Pleural ultrasound is a non-invasive examination that can be performed in the patient's bed (lying or sitting). In trained hands, it may be more sensitive than radiography for detecting small pneumothoraces.

A chest CT scan is the most sensitive examination (a normal CT scan rules out the presence of a pneumothorax) but is not essential for diagnosis. Its main indications are:

- Chest X-ray difficult to interpret
- Recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax looking for apical bubbles or underlying lung disease
- Assessment for certain ""at risk"" professionals (divers, pilots)
- Traumatic pneumothorax: look for other associated traumatic abnormalities

MRI and FDG PET-CT have no place in the assessment of pneumothorax.

Migraine with aura is an independent risk factor for cerebral infarction. The risk is doubled in a person suffering from migraine with aura and increases with cofactors such as female sex, age under 45, smoking, and oestroprogestogenic contraception.

**In Practice:** Before prescribing oral contraception, systematically check for migraine and determine whether it is without aura or with aura. Then, assess all arterial risk factors:

- Age > 35
- Smoking
- Family history of stroke or myocardial infarction
- Hypertension (SD-042)
- Dyslipidaemia
- Obesity

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

## Conducting a Pain Interview

- Diagnosis and assessment of pain intensity using a validated self-assessment scale (EVA, EN, EVS) must be actively undertaken by carers without waiting for the complaint. It is compulsory and must be recorded in the patient's file, regardless of the reason for hospitalization.
- It is an essential prerequisite for initiating treatment and can be carried out by any healthcare professional (medical students, doctors, psychologists, physiotherapists, nurses, midwives, dentists, pharmacists).
- Diagnosis and assessment of acute and chronic pain.

### Objectives

- **Screening and diagnosis of the nature of the patient's pain** (acute or chronic, neuropathic, nociceptive, nociplastic, visceral, mixed).
- Evaluate the location of the pain, whether it is diffuse or focal, radiating, its characteristics (type of pain, factors reducing or increasing the pain, etc.), associated symptoms and clinical signs (nausea, vomiting, fever, redness on inspection, tenderness on palpation of the abdomen, etc.).
- Assess the intensity of the pain by encouraging the patient to self-assess using validated scales (EN 0-10 oral or visual and VAS: pain intensity mild if <4, moderate between 4 and 6, severe if > 6, EVS in 5 descriptors).
- **Evaluate the efficacy, tolerance, and compliance with analgesic treatment** whether medicinal or not.
- The specific objectives of the interview and assessment differ depending on whether the pain is acute or chronic.
  - In the case of acute pain (often nociceptive, traumatic, or post-operative), the therapeutic objective is curative, and etiological treatment is possible. Assessment is generally limited to the pain area, pain intensity (rest, effort), consumption of analgesics, and sometimes associated anxiety.
  - In the case of chronic pain (a ""multi-dimensional"" entity with sensory, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral components), the objectives are symptomatic, and etiological treatment is rarely possible (HAS 1999 recommendations). Assessment takes time and can be spread over several consultations.
  - **It involves an etiological assessment with an interview, a clinical examination, and, if necessary, additional tests.**

## Tools and Scales for Assessing Pain

### General Principles

- Always use the same scale for the same patient unless there are changes in cognitive ability.
- If the patient has several painful sites, each pain must be assessed separately.

### Self-assessment Scales for Pain and Its Impact

- Aimed at **communicating** patients, i.e., children over the age of 6 or adults able to communicate verbally (no major cognitive disorders or disorders of consciousness).
- They mainly comprise ""pain intensity scales"" and ""multidimensional scales.""
- Intensity scales can be used to assess the intensity of pain at the present time or over the last 24 hours, and if necessary, to identify the 'emergency' to be treated, the level of painkillers to be used, the evolution of the pain, and the patient's level of relief.
- Multidimensional scales take into account different aspects of chronic pain and its repercussions. The most widely used is the McGill Pain Questionnaire, which explores the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. These scales should only be used in the management of chronic pain.
- The assessment of chronic pain can be supplemented by scales for depression, anxiety, quality of life, and sleep, which are not specific to pain. The most widely used scale is the Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), which assesses the anxiety and/or depression component in chronic pain patients.

### Pain Intensity Scales

- **The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS):** Generally takes the form of a 100 mm ruler, horizontal (adult) or vertical (child), with one end corresponding to ""no pain"" and the other to ""maximum imaginable pain."" The patient moves a cursor to the point where they feel the most pain, allowing the carer to determine the precise intensity of the pain (in cm or mm).
- **The Numerical Scale (EN):** Provides a numerical scoring system with or without visual support. Patients quantify the intensity of their pain from 0 to 10 at a given moment. Visual support can help in critical situations (pre-hospital, emergency, intensive care, post-interventional care room) or with less cooperative patients.
- **The Simple Verbal Scale (EVS):** Aimed at patients generally unable to use the previous scales. Includes qualifiers such as: no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, very severe pain. The EVS should not be simplified to the simple question ""are you in pain?""

### Pain Hetero-assessment Scales

- Aimed at patients with **verbal communication disorders**.
- Require the clinician to observe the patient's pain behavior and quantify it using a validated score: these scales are also known as behavioral scales. Each type of population (young children, post-operative young children, non-communicative elderly people, confused or sedated adult patients) has its own behavioral scales, validated in each typical population.
- Areas of behavioral observation most frequently included in these scales are:
  - Facial expression (mimicry, grimace) and crying.
  - Vocalization or verbalization of pain.
- Each hetero-evaluation scale has a threshold score associated with pain of significant intensity. These thresholds mean that clinicians must consider finding the cause of the pain and treating it.",0.8888888888888888,16.4,False,True,0.7259054780006409,0.6448649168014526,a,False,2,4

== Acute Pyelonephritis ==

=== Antibiotic Treatment ===

Before any antibiotic treatment, an ECBU (urine culture) must be carried out.

In the event of fever in a child with signs of urinary tract infection (clinical signs, positive urine dipstick), probabilistic antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible after an ECBU has been performed. This is to eradicate the infection, prevent bacteraemia, improve clinical condition, and reduce the risk of renal damage during the acute phase of the infection and the risk of renal scarring.

- **IV Treatment Followed by PO:**
  - In case of complication factors and/or age < 3 months and/or doubt about compliance with oral treatment:
    - Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime or amikacin followed by oral retreatment.
  - In the event of signs of severity:
    - Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime + amikacin.
  - Followed by PO after 2 to 4 days, depending on the results of the antibiogram and once apyrexia has been achieved, by treatment with cefixime or cotrimoxazole (after 1 month) for 10 to 14 days.

- **Initial Oral Treatment with Cefixime:**
  - After 3 months, in the absence of risk factors or signs of severity and if home monitoring is possible and appropriate.
  - To be adapted to the antibiogram, followed by cotrimoxazole if sensitive, to avoid prolonged use of oral C3G with a high potential for selecting resistant bacteria.

In case of G+ cocci on direct examination: suspect enterococcus, and choose amoxicillin (in combination with gentamicin in case of sepsis).

=== Hospitalisation Criteria ===

- Age < 3 months
- Signs of severity
- Difficult to monitor at home

== Cystitis ==

Initial treatment of lower urinary tract infections or cystitis in children involves oral outpatient treatment with cefixime, cotrimoxazole, or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, followed by adjustment according to the results of the ECBU.

- Duration: 3 to 5 days
- Look for factors that may contribute to the disease

== Follow-Up, Complications, and Uropathy Research ==

- **Complications of ANP:**
  - Short-term: abscess, sepsis
  - Long-term: risk of hypertension if multiple, untreated, or delayed ANP (renal scarring)

- **Look for Uropathy:**
  - ANP is favored by vesico-ureteral reflux, which may be functional or malformative (uropathy).
    - Systematic ultrasound at first episode
    - Retrograde cystography if abnormal echo or recurrent ANP (apart from favoring factors such as bladder instability).
  - Beware of posterior urethral valves in infant boys, which is a medical-surgical emergency. Be aware of abnormalities on ultrasound (struggling bladder, dilated urinary tract), abnormal renal function, abnormal micturition stream, etc.
  - Examine the sacral region carefully and check that the neurological examination is normal (spinal cord abnormality).

- **Follow-Up:**
  - For ANP: ensure apyrexia. If fever persists, suspect a complication (abscess), check compliance if oral treatment, check sensitivity to antibiotic susceptibility test.
  - For cystitis: look for contributing factors in the event of recurrence, in particular constipation, unstable bladder, etc.
  - Nephrological or uropaediatric opinion if:
    - Voiding abnormalities (pollakiuria, leakage, poor stream in male infants = urethral valves)
    - Repeated infections

Acute abnormalities are located on the ST segment and the T wave. They are associated with a myocardial territory (V1-V4: anteroseptoapical; DII, DIII, aVF: inferior; DI, aVL: high lateral and V5, V6: low lateral; V3R, V4R: right ventricle; V7 to V9: posterior). Classically, a distinction is made between two types:

- **Acute Coronary Syndrome with ST-Segment Elevation:**
  - ST elevation ‚â• 2 mm in precordial and ‚â• 1 mm in inferior and high lateral,
  - In at least 2 contiguous leads of the same coronary territory,
  - Usually associated mirror sub-shift,
  - A new left bundle branch block is considered equivalent to ST+ if associated with a suggestive acute presentation.

The SCA ST+ lower and lower lateral is an important consideration in diagnosis.

- **Acute Coronary Syndrome without ST-Segment Elevation (i.e., without persistent ST-segment elevation of more than 20 minutes):**
  - May show ST-segment sub-shift (more reliable if horizontal or descending),
  - Negative T waves,
  - Or a normal ECG, particularly when post-critical.

The SCA ST- is another critical diagnostic factor.

- **Aortic Dissection:**
  - ECG generally normal but may be ST+ if dissection extends to a coronary artery.

- **Pulmonary Embolism:**
  - Sinus tachycardia (>100/min),
  - S1Q3 appearance (S wave in DI and Q in DIII),
  - Right bundle branch block,
  - Negativation of T waves from V1 to V3 or even V4,
  - Note: ECG abnormalities may be absent.

Pulmonary embolism can present with sinus tachycardia and S1Q3 patterns.

- **Pericarditis with Tamponade:**
  - Diffuse ST segment elevation (not systematised to a coronary territory) and concave upward ST segment elevation, without mirror, without Q wave,
  - Sub-shift of the PQ then progression to diffuse negativation of the T waves,
  - Finally, normalisation of the ECG over several weeks,
  - Other anomalies suggestive of tamponade: microvoltage, electrical alternation (variation in the amplitude of the QRS, generally 1 in 2).

Pericarditis can show diffuse ST segment elevation and other characteristic ECG changes.",0.5,22.3625,False,True,0.801972508430481,0.661535640557607,a,False,2,4

The onset of puberty is hypothalamic: reactivation of the GnRH pulsatility (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone). GnRH stimulates the anteropituitary secretion of the gonadotropins FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone). The appearance of this pulsatility is modulated by neuroendocrine and peripheral factors, in particular leptin produced by adipose tissue, genetic and ethnic factors, nutritional status, and intercurrent pathologies.

- **In Boys:**  
  - FSH is responsible for the growth of testicular volume.  
  - LH stimulates the production of testosterone, which is responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics (penis, hair) as well as musculoskeletal changes.

- **In Girls:**  
  - LH and FSH lead to ovarian activation and the production of oestrogens.  
  - Oestrogens cause mammary, uterovaginal, and OGE development, followed by the appearance of the first menstrual periods (menarche).

Pubic hair is linked to the production of gonadal and adrenal androgens.

The increase in sex hormones increases the frequency and amplitude of growth hormone (GH) secretion peaks, and the speed of statural growth accelerates (pubertal growth peak).",0.6666666666666666,14.646666666666672,False,True,0.725596010684967,0.7364184657732645,b,False,4,4

**Rubric:** Definition  

== Definitions ==

In health research, the characteristics studied are ""biomedical"" criteria, which are inherently variable. Studies allow observation of a sample of these variables. Statistical tests help determine whether the observed result can (null hypothesis) or cannot (alternative hypothesis) be explained by chance, by setting a threshold for the risk of error (alpha risk of 1st species, often set at 5%).

The value of a study lies in its ""inference""‚Äîextrapolating observed results from a sample to the population. The risk of error due to sampling fluctuations can be quantified by statistical tests and confidence intervals.

In science, the ""hypothetico-deductive approach"" involves formulating hypotheses and testing their validity through experiments and data collection.

== Null Hypotheses and Alternatives ==

In statistics, a hypothesis test decides between two hypotheses:

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The hypothesis we aim to reject, but with little chance of rejection if true. For example, the effect of treatment A is the same as treatment B. The first-order risk, ""alpha,"" is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, often set at 5%.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The complementary hypothesis to the null, which we aim to accept. For example, the effect of treatment A differs from treatment B. The second-order risk, ""beta,"" is the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative is true. The power of the test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if the alternative is true (1-beta).

== Power of a Statistical Test ==

A statistical test is designed to be as powerful as possible for a fixed first-species risk (often 5%). The power of a test is influenced by several parameters:

- **Size of Sample (N):** If N increases, power increases.
- **Difference to be Detected (d):** If d increases, power increases.
- **Variability of Observations (Variance):** If variance increases, power decreases.
- **Alpha Risk:** If alpha increases, power increases.
- **One-tailed or Two-tailed Test:** If the test is one-tailed, power increases.

In practice, controllable parameters in a biomedical study include the alpha risk (set), the construction of a one- or two-tailed test, and the sample size (determined by calculating the required number of subjects).

== Stages of a Statistical Test ==

A statistical test follows these steps:

1. Define the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Set the risk of error of the first kind.
3. Determine a rejection zone for the null hypothesis based on expected observations if the null hypothesis were true.
4. Verify if study observations are consistent with expectations under the null hypothesis.
5. If consistent, do not reject the null hypothesis (this does not confirm its truth due to non-zero beta risk). If the null hypothesis implies equality, conclude no significant difference.
6. If not consistent, reject the null hypothesis, allowing a conclusion in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the null hypothesis implies equality, conclude a significant difference.
7. Calculate the significance level.

== Single or Bilateral Test ==

When the null hypothesis implies equality, the alternative hypothesis can be:

- **Bilateral:** Corresponds to a difference, regardless of direction. For example, the effect of treatment A is greater than or less than treatment B.
- **Unilateral:** Corresponds to a difference in one direction. For example, the effect of treatment A is greater than treatment B, but not vice versa. A non-significant bilateral difference may be significant unilaterally.

== Independence or Matching of Observations ==

In a study, measurements can be independent or paired:

- **Independent Measurements:** Obtained from different individuals, e.g., blood glucose measurement 7 days after study inclusion.
- **Matched Measurements:** Obtained from the same or matched individuals, e.g., blood glucose measurement at inclusion and 7 days later.

Statistical tests differ for independent or paired data but follow the same steps.

== Parametric and Non-Parametric Tests ==

Each statistical test has application conditions based on the probability law of the random variables analyzed.

- **Parametric Test:** Based on a hypothesis about the probability distribution, e.g., Student's t-test assumes a normal distribution.
- **Non-Parametric Test:** Makes no assumptions about the probability distribution.

== Choice of Statistical Test ==

The choice depends on:

- **Endpoint Type:** Variable to be explained or dependent variable.
- **Exposure Factor Type:** Independent or explanatory variable.
- **Data Structure:** Independent or matched.
- **Sample Size and Distribution:** Parametric tests require certain conditions (sample size ‚â• 30, normal distribution). Otherwise, a non-parametric test is needed.

A clinico-biological examination is carried out prior to MAP to investigate and identify the causes of the couple's infertility. It is also used to assess the benefit-risk balance of MAP treatment for the individuals concerned.

It includes, as a minimum, the following examinations, following a medical history to look for specific risk factors:

- Clinical examination of both members of the couple if necessary
- Examination of the cycle and ovarian status
- Uterine and/or uterotubal examination as appropriate
- Spermogram, spermocytogram, sperm culture, and sperm survival migration test if appropriate
- Testicular ultrasound and even sperm excretory tract ultrasound if necessary, in the event of alterations in sperm parameters
- Health safety tests on both members of the couple or on the unmarried woman

For a detailed exploration of infertility, refer to the LISA sheet for item 38 (Couple's infertility, what to do at the first consultation).

""Health security tests"" include HBV, HCV, HIV, and syphilis serologies for both members of the couple or the unmarried woman. For people vaccinated against hepatitis B, a serological check is not necessary if immunity is known and documented.

The sperm survival migration test is indicated prior to MPA, in order to choose the most appropriate MPA technique. This test selects the most mobile spermatozoa and induces sperm capacitation. The result is an estimated number of progressively mobile spermatozoa ""usable"" for MPA.

A psycho-social assessment, involving an interview with a psychologist, may be offered to all couples undergoing MAP. An interview with a psychiatrist or a psychologist attached to the team is recommended (and systematically offered) for couples or unmarried women having recourse to gamete or embryo donation.

**Rubric:** Definition  

**Definitions**

""Survival data"" is a generic term used to describe the time until the occurrence of any event (e.g., death, relapse, appearance of a metastasis, hospital discharge, extubation, recovery). They reflect both the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of the event and the follow-up time of the subject, known as ""survival time."" They are also called ""censored variables"" because of their incomplete nature:

- If the event occurs, the survival time is the time after which the event occurs (e.g., the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and death).
- When the event is not observed during follow-up, there is ""censoring"": the survival time is then equal to the time during which the subject was observed (e.g., the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and the end of the study). If an individual is ""lost to view"" before the end of the study (e.g., following a move abroad), this is also considered as censoring. In these cases, the survival time of the subject is the time between inclusion in the study and the subject's last follow-up visit. It is not equal to the time until the occurrence of an event because it was not observed, but it provides information on the fact that during the entire follow-up period, the event did not occur for this subject.

Methodologies adapted to this incomplete nature are therefore needed to account for this censoring of survival time.

The Kaplan-Meier method can be used to estimate survival at each time t (probability of not experiencing the event before t) and can be represented graphically as a ""survival curve."" A survival curve starts at 1 (no subject has yet experienced the event at time 0, so the probability of survival at time 0 is 1) and then decreases over time as the event occurs for each subject in the sample (staircase). The vertical lines represent censures, i.e., the last visit of individuals lost to follow-up. The ""median survival,"" which is the time after which 50% of the individuals in the sample experienced the event (it may be unknown if less than 50% of the individuals experienced the event), is often used to describe the survival of a sample. In this example, it is 6 months.

The log-rank test is used to compare (univariate) the survival curves of two (or more) samples. The hazard ratio is an estimate of the instantaneous risk of the event occurring over time. It is interpreted as a relative risk. The value observed in a sample is always accompanied by its confidence interval. It can be estimated in a multivariate (adjusted) analysis, most often using a regression model known as the Cox model.",1.0,11.22727272727273,False,True,0.7638530731201172,0.536652684211731,c,False,3,4

**Title:** Knowing the Benefit/Risk Ratio and Net Benefit from Available Information  
**Description:** Identify the sources of variation in the benefit/risk ratio  

== Benefit/Risk Ratio ==  
A medicine is likely to obtain marketing authorisation (MA) for a given indication if its benefit/risk ratio in that same indication is favorable, i.e., when the expected benefits are superior to the expected risks.

=== Ongoing Re-evaluation ===  
Assessing the benefit/risk ratio involves evaluating both the benefits and the risks. However, when marketing authorisation is granted, the benefit/risk ratio is generally assessed based on data from clinical trials involving a limited number of patients. It is necessary to continue analyzing the benefit/risk ratio based on accumulating available information, even after marketing authorisation has been obtained.

The benefit/risk ratio is not fixed. It must be constantly updated in light of new knowledge, and its re-evaluation may lead to the modification, suspension, or withdrawal of a marketing authorisation.

=== Estimation at Population or Individual Level ===  
Estimation of the benefit/risk balance is useful at various stages of drug development.

- Manufacturers use it to decide whether or not to continue the development of a medicine.
- Competent authorities use it to decide whether or not to grant marketing authorisation.

- Short-acting B2-mimetic bronchodilators (SADB) (metered dose inhaler or powder inhaler): treatment for asthma symptoms or exacerbation.
- Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (metered dose inhaler or powder inhaler): the most effective background treatment prescribed for all persistent asthma.
- Long-acting B2-mimetic bronchodilators (LABD) (metered dose inhaler or powder inhaler): always prescribed in combination with ICS (never prescribe LABD alone in asthma because of the risk of GAD).
- Anti-leukotriene (montelukast) (oral): alternative to BDLA.

All asthma is treated with BDCA as a matter of course. Background treatment is initiated if symptoms are frequent (<2/month). Treatment is adjusted in stages according to the level of asthma control.

If asthma is not controlled with ICS and BDLA, additional treatment should be discussed during a specialist consultation (long-acting anti-cholinergic, anti-IgE immunotherapy, anti-IL5, long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy).

### Knowing Water-borne Parasites

- **Amoebiasis**
- **Cryptosporidiosis**
- **Toxoplasmosis**
- **Giardiasis**

### Etiologies

#### Amoebiasis

Amoebiasis is a protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is cosmopolitan but predominates in areas with poor hygiene. It is transmitted by ingestion of water or food contaminated with cysts, which are highly resistant in the external environment. Once ingested, the cysts give rise to amoebiasis infestation (vegetative forms) and/or amoebiasis disease with intestinal +/- hepatic tropism, through invasion of tissues by vegetative forms of *Entamoeba histolytica histolytica*.

#### Cryptosporidiosis

Cryptosporidiosis is a protozoonosis, transmitted by faeco-oral or manuported transmission, which is also cosmopolitan. Clinical signs include acute choleriform or chronic diarrhea and malabsorption in immunocompromised patients.

#### Giardiasis

Giardiasis is a cosmopolitan protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is transmitted via the faeco-oral route or during sexual relations between men. Transmission occurs through ingestion of cysts, which transform into vegetative forms in the intestinal lumen. Clinical symptoms are often asymptomatic, but chronic diarrhea may be present in children, leading to malabsorption syndrome or malnutrition in low-resource countries.

#### Toxoplasmosis

Toxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis. The causative agent is a protozoan whose definitive host is the cat (the only host that excretes oocysts), with humans and other mammals as intermediate hosts. Humans ingest oocysts via food or water contaminated with cat feces and can also become infected by ingesting cysts present in the meat of other intermediate hosts infested with cysts. The clinical course of primary infection is symptomatic in only 20% of cases and is aspecific (fever, polyadenopathy, odynophagia, etc.). Severity is linked to immunodepression (primary infection or reactivation) or in congenital forms.",0.75,14.9875,False,True,0.7210917472839355,0.6907164851824442,a,False,3,3

**Title:** Sampling Methods  
**Description:** How to Define Sampling Methods  
**Rubric:** Definition  

It is often impossible to study a given population as a whole. We then examine a subset of individuals (or sample) to deduce, from the observations made on this sample, what exists in the target population.

A sample must be selected to be as representative as possible of the source population from which it is drawn. To achieve this, there are various sampling methods:

- **If a sampling frame (exhaustive list of individuals in the source population) is available:**

  - Exhaustive recruitment: if possible, all the individuals listed are recruited.
  - Random draw:
    - Simple random sampling
    - Stratified survey: the source population is divided into sub-populations according to a categorical variable (for example, age categorized into 5 modalities, i.e., strata: <18 years, 18-34 years, 35-49 years, 50-64 years, 65 years and over) and individuals are drawn at random within each sub-population. The aim is to ensure that all 5 age categories are represented in the sample drawn.
    - Cluster sampling: not individuals but collective units (clusters) are drawn (e.g., hospital services, departments, schools, etc.) and all the individuals in the collective unit drawn are included.

- **No survey database available:**

  - Consecutive recruitment: individuals are included as and when they are presented at the inclusion centers and throughout the inclusion period. Ensures good representativeness of the source population if refusals to participate or non-response are low.
    - Exhaustive if possible
    - Otherwise: random or systematic selection (1 in 2 or 3, etc.)
  - Quota method: consists of ensuring that a sample is representative by assigning it a similar structure (according to certain characteristics, for example: age, gender, department of residence, etc.) to that of the source population.

**Rubric:** Definition

Social protection accounted for 35% of France's Gross Domestic Product in 2020, considering the onset of the Covid-19 epidemic.

In response to the economic and health crisis, social protection benefits rose sharply in France, by 6.8% in 2020 after a 2.6% increase in 2019, reaching ‚Ç¨813 billion, or 35% of GDP. Additionally, total social protection expenditure other than benefits (‚Ç¨59 billion) rose significantly by 24.6% compared to a 2.0% decrease in 2019. This non-benefits item includes additional expenditure linked to the health crisis, amounting to ‚Ç¨11 billion, such as the purchase of masks and equipment or financial aid granted to healthcare professionals due to reduced activity during confinements.

The two main social risks accounting for the largest financial burden remain old age (43%) and health (33%) of social protection expenditure. The growth in social protection expenditure is linked to employment support measures as a result of the introduction of short-time working.

The Higham score is used to assess menorrhagia severity.

Old-age and survivors' benefits have slowed down since the introduction of four major reforms to the pension system in 1993, 2003, 2008, and 2010: 
1. Indexation of pensions to inflation rather than wages.
2. Calculation of pensions based on the best 25 years instead of the best 10 in the private sector.
3. Increase in the number of years needed to qualify for the full rate.
4. Increase in the legal age for entitlement from 60 to 62.

However, the average amount of pensions is inevitably increasing in social protection for several reasons:
1. The rise in real wages over the generations.
2. The retirement of baby-boomers, who outnumber current generations.
3. Longer life expectancy.

Regarding health risk, the rate of increase in expenditure has been slowed since the 1980s by several reform plans:
1. 1982-1983: Reduction in the reimbursement of certain drugs.
2. 1986 and 1993: Increased the proportion of expenditure to be borne by households.
3. 1996: Introduction of the national target for health insurance expenditure (Ondam), which aims to control expenditure by basic schemes. This target was regularly exceeded until 2009, but the 2004 Health Act and ongoing strengthening of its control and monitoring mechanisms have ensured that it has been respected since 2010.

However, health insurance benefits in France will increase by 4.3% (after a 2.4% increase in 2019) to ‚Ç¨228 billion. This increase can be explained by:

- Increases in the provision of care in the hospital sector and, to a lesser extent, in outpatient care. Despite an overall fall in the volume of care outside Covid-19-related care, public hospital expenditure has increased due to higher remuneration (Covid-19 bonuses, S√©gur de la sant√© measures) and the additional costs of caring for patients with Covid-19. Outpatient treatment is also increasing, despite the drop in consultations with GPs and specialists due to the epidemic, but there has been a significant rise in laboratory procedures (Covid-19 screening tests).
- Daily benefits (IJ) increased by 24.4% in 2020 for two reasons. Firstly, the so-called ""derogatory"" IJs were used to compensate people who had to stop working during the initial confinement (parents without childcare, vulnerable people, self-employed workers). Secondly, sick pay also increased due to sick leave linked to the epidemic waves.
- Medical and social benefits (health and disability) will also increase in 2020. As in the hospital sector, this increase is primarily the result of pay rises for employees working in the facilities, as well as additional funding paid out to deal with the health crisis. Disability benefits will increase by 3.6% (after a 3.3% increase in 2019), due to the automatic extension of entitlement to disability compensation benefits. On the other hand, benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases will fall in 2020 as a result of the fall in the number of accidents at work, which in turn is due to the reduction in professional activities and the massive use of teleworking during the pandemic.",0.8571428571428571,15.15571428571429,False,True,0.8210875988006592,0.763541559378306,b,True,4,3

No melanoderma, replaced by pallor.

Depending on the etiology, it may be associated with signs of deficiency of other pituitary hormones, a tumor syndrome with signs of chiasmatic compression, and headaches (see Pituitary adenoma).

**Description:** In adults and children:

- **Chronic headache:** Present for at least 3 months, generally lasting for months or years.
  - Most often a primary headache.
  - Assess the number of headache days per month over the last three months.

- **Episodic chronic headache (<15 headache days/month):**
  - Migraine (known as episodic)
  - Episodic tension headache

- **Chronic daily headache (CCQ, 15 days or more/month) subdivided into:**
  - **Long-term QCC** (seizures > 4 hours)
    - Chronic migraine if the headache has the characteristics of a migraine for at least 8 days a month
    - Chronic tension headache, if no migraine characteristic
    - Both may or may not be associated with drug abuse, which is a complication and/or aggravating factor in the underlying primary headache.
  - **Short-term QCC** (attacks < 4 hours): facial vascular angina (FVA) and other trigeminal-autonomic headaches, mainly to be distinguished from painful cranial neuropathy (trigeminal neuralgia).

- **Etiological diagnosis** is based on questioning: in the presence of a chronic headache (long-standing and habitual), determine the duration of untreated attacks, the characteristics of the headache, and associated signs. This is most often a primary headache. A distinction is made between:
  - **Migraine:**
    - Migraine without aura
    - Migraine with aura: progressive, successive, and transient neurological disorders (< 1 hour) preceding or accompanying the headache at its onset, most often visual signs, sometimes sensory, rarely language disorders.
  - **Tension headache**
  - **Algie vasculaire de la face** to be distinguished from trigeminal neuralgia

- **Chronic post-traumatic headache:** Long-term QCC that persists >3 months after a head injury, follows acute post-traumatic headache (< 3 months), and may be accompanied by a post-traumatic syndrome (vertigo, sleep disorders, difficulty concentrating, mood disorder). Resembles a chronic migraine or chronic tension headache.

- **Chronic headache of cervical origin:** Certain rheumatological conditions can cause headaches (severe osteoarthritis and/or disco-radicular conflict, sequelae of fracture/dislocation of a cervical vertebra, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.). Headaches are generally posterior with paravertebral muscle contractures.

**Title:** Knowing the natural evolution of a person with trisomy 21 throughout their life.

**Description:** Know the natural history, main complications, and management of people with trisomy 21.

**Rubric:** Management

A person with trisomy 21 is born with axial hypotonia associated with varying degrees of medical complications (sometimes none, often several). Medical complications need to be treated early, and rehabilitation needs to be started quickly. Rehabilitation can take place in the private sector or in a CAMSP (Centre d'action m√©dico-sociale pr√©coce for 0-6 year olds) then SESSAD (Service d'√©ducation sp√©ciale et de soins √† domicile, up to the age of 20).

Throughout life, it is important to know how to look for the main complications (see ""Evolution of trisomy 21 (2C-045-SP-A01)"") and to treat them to avoid, in particular, over-handicap (vision problems, hypoacusis, hypothyroidism).

People with trisomy 21 have a margin of progression, which varies from one patient to another and is impossible to predict. They have a psychomotor delay (""Anomaly of psychomotor development (SD-115)""). For example, walking is acquired on average between 2 and 3 years of age, compared with between 9 and 18 months for a child without Down's syndrome. Language acquisition is often the most delayed, accompanied by speech disorders (""Speech and/or phonation disorders (SD-134)"").

Puberty proceeds normally.

People with trisomy 21 are often short (over -2 DS) (""Anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth (SD-026)"") and have a tendency to develop obesity, which should be treated by hygienic and dietary measures and by encouraging the practice of sport.

The majority of children with Down's syndrome are able to recognize words, and even to read, write a few words, and count a little, allowing them a degree of independence.

Inclusion in the mainstream environment should be encouraged as far as possible, either in normal classes or in adapted classes (ULIS: Unit√©s Localis√©es pour l'Inclusion Scolaire). If the child has reached his or her limits in terms of acquiring school skills, he or she may be admitted to an IME (Institut m√©dico-√©ducatif) or an IMPro (Institut m√©dico-professionnel) to work on independence and learn a trade.

Adults with Down's syndrome can be housed (rare). They can work in a mainstream workplace (rare), work in an ESAT (√âtablissement et service d'aide par le travail, the majority), stay with their parents, or move into a so-called occupational home.

Adults with Down's syndrome usually have an emotional life, and some women (rare) have children.

In adulthood, the question arises of guardianship, curatorship, or family administrative supervision to protect these people, particularly financially.

From their fifties onwards, people with Down's syndrome begin to experience the complications associated with premature ageing and an increased risk of dementia, particularly of the Alzheimer's type (""Memory impairment/cognitive decline (SD-131)"").

Potassium is the main cation in intracellular fluids, where its concentration varies from 100 to 150 mEq/L. In a 70 kg man, potassium represents a stock of around 3,750 mmol, 98% of which is located in the intracellular compartment. The skeletal muscle cell constitutes the largest potassium reserve. For a 70 kg man, 28 kg of muscle cells correspond to 2,600 mmol of potassium.

Potassium is not very abundant in the extracellular compartment (less than 2% of total potassium) but its plasma concentration is very finely regulated. Normal plasma values are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L. Kalaemia is finely regulated by internal regulatory systems, linked to NaK-ATPase activity, and external systems (mainly kidneys, adrenals, liver, and digestive tract):

**Internal Systems Regulating Intracellular Potassium Transfer via NaK-ATPase Activity:**
- Catecholamines, which stimulate cellular uptake of K+ (Œ≤-adrenergic effect)
- Insulin, which stimulates cellular K+ entry
- Acid-base state: Metabolic acidosis blocks cellular K+ entry (inhibition of NaK-ATPase). It also increases the passive leakage of potassium into the extracellular sector.

== Definitions/Population Concerned ==  
All children with a serious life-threatening illness, whether life-limiting (no hope of cure, usual early death) or life-threatening (curative treatment possible but high risk of premature death).

Six groups were identified according to life-threatening or life-limiting pathology, including:

- Group 5: Newborns with very limited life expectancy.  
- Palliative care does not stop when the child dies. It includes support for the family's bereavement:  
- Group 6: Members of a family who have lost a child unexpectedly as a result of illness, a situation caused by an external cause or a loss during the perinatal period, e.g., trauma, stillbirths, abortions.

== Integrated, Non-Sequential Approach ==  
Early palliative care may be concomitant with any curative care. In all cases, it involves active management. It is the intensity and objective of the treatments that are discussed.

== Graduated Organisation ==  
For complex situations, frontline teams can call on regional pediatric palliative care resource teams (ERRSPP) or pediatric EMSP mobile palliative care teams, including at home.

== Triangulation: Child - Parents - Carers ==  
Integrate the coexistence of parental competence and vulnerability.

== Three Perinatal Situations ==  

**Antenatal**  

- Extreme prematurity at the limits of viability: high risk of mortality and morbidity, particularly neurological.  
  - <22SA and/or <500g: fetus (antenatal) / newborn (after birth) said to be non-viable.  
  - <24SA: Most French teams do not resuscitate.  
  - Between 24 and 26 weeks' gestation: on a case-by-case basis.  
  - The parents' wishes, informed of the severity of the prognosis, are an important factor in the decision.  

- Incurable and particularly serious genetic diseases and malformations.  
  - After antenatal diagnosis, if the parents wish to continue the pregnancy and do not request a medical termination of pregnancy (IMG). Uncertainty is often at its greatest. There is the possibility of fetal death in utero, death at birth, or a life of unpredictable duration, very short or prolonged over months or years with a severe disability. Thinking about all these possibilities at the same time: psychological violence for the parents.  
  - Information for parents, diagnostic reassessment at birth.  
  - When in doubt, intensive management of organ failure will be initiated. In some cases, resuscitation on standby and urgent collegial consultation are necessary.  

**Post-natal**  

- Neonatal resuscitation situations with therapeutic impasse or diagnosis of particularly serious neurological lesions (extreme prematurity or severe perinatal anoxia). The question arises of a decision to limit or stop treatment by collegial procedure in accordance with the Clayes-Leonetti law.  

== Palliative Care in the Delivery Room ==  
However short it may be, it is a time for living and not a time for waiting for death. Draw on the concepts developed by developmental care. Parents will be involved according to their wishes.

- Hetero-evaluation via the NFCS Neonatal Face Coding System, EDIN scales (Newborn Pain and Discomfort Scale).  
- Analgesic and/or sedative treatments in the event of symptoms: sucrose (sugar solution), morphine, midazolam (usually oral).

== In the Event of Death ==  
- Respect and propose rituals and memorial traces.  
- In the event of the death of a viable newborn (>22SA; weight >500g) who is still alive, there is a specific neonatal death certificate (D0-J28).

**Title:** Knowing the Main Additional Tests to be Prescribed for Hematuria  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Complementary Examinations  

**Definitions**  
Hematuria, whether microscopic or macroscopic, always requires a clinical, biological, and radiological etiological investigation. Isolated macroscopic hematuria should always rule out a urological cause before considering a nephrological cause.

**Confirmatory Tests**  
The urine culture (ECBU) can be used to confirm hematuria (presence of red blood cells in the urine), quantify it, and rule out a urinary tract infection.

**Minimal Work-Up and Assessment**  
- Blood count (CBC)  
- Hemostasis work-up (TP/TCA +/- INR)  
- Assessment of renal function (creatinine level and GFR estimate)  
- Proteinuria detection by dipstick and quantification if positive  

**Minimal Etiological Work-Up**  
- **First Intention Urinary Tract Imaging and Urinary Cytology:** Most often involves urethrovesical fibroscopy (second intention). This work-up must be carried out early.  
  - **Urinary Cytology:** Conducted on morning urine outside the hematuric episode. The pathologist looks for high-grade tumor cells, indicating a potential bladder urothelial carcinoma or upper excretory tract issue.  
  - **First Line Imaging:** Renal-vesical ultrasound  
  - **Uro-Scanner:** Systematic reference examination. It includes an injection-free phase to look for calculi in the urinary tree and assess spontaneous densities, an arterial phase for contrast from renal, bladder, or upper excretory tract tumors, or vascular anomalies, and a late excretory phase which may be combined with a nephrographic phase, often sensitized by the injection of a diuretic. The late excretory time is used to visualize gaps in the urinary tree. Uro-MRI is used when iodine is contraindicated.  
  - **Traumatic Hematuria:** May require, after CT scan, diagnostic and/or therapeutic arteriography in case of active bleeding (arterioembolization).  
  - **Urethrovesical Fibroscopy (or Flexible Urethrocystoscopy):** Performed by a urologist under local anesthetic. Indications include imaging with no obvious etiology, positive urine cytology (CIS = carcinoma in situ), or risk factors for urothelial tumors (age, smoking, or occupational exposure). Inspection of the ureteral meatus can sometimes reveal bloody urine ejaculate and lateralize hematuria from the upper excretory tract. When the etiological diagnosis is obvious (e.g., large bladder tumor), urethrovesical fibroscopy is not necessary. Fibroscopy does not allow biopsies or polyp resection (endoscopic resection using a rigid urethro-cystoscope in the operating theatre under anesthetic).  
  - **Rigid or Flexible Ureteroscopy:** Explores the ureter and renal cavities under general anesthetic in the operating theatre. Indicated if a tumor of the upper urinary excretory tract is suspected.  

**Nephrological Referral**  
In the event of nephrological referral (suggestive personal or family history, edema of the lower limbs, arterial hypertension, renal insufficiency, presence of blood vessels, etc.):  
- Search for proteinuria (24-hour proteinuria or urine protein/creatinine ratio on sample), ideally outside a hematuric episode.  
- A 24-hour proteinuria >2g or a urine protein/creatinine ratio >2g/g (especially if >70% albumin) is suggestive of glomerular hematuria.  
- Indication for renal biopsy under ultrasound, discussed if microscopic hematuria is associated with glomerular proteinuria or in cases of recurrent macroscopic hematuria without urological etiology (e.g., IgA nephropathy).  

**Follow-Up**  
If no etiology is found in this work-up (< 10% of clinical situations, mostly microscopic hematuria), the work-up should be repeated if the hematuria persists or recurs, especially in patients who smoke or are > 40 years old.",0.875,16.028235294117646,False,True,0.7768275737762451,0.6881315509478251,a,False,4,4

**Rubric:** Definition  

Researchers communicate and share their findings by publishing scientific articles in general or specialist journals. The ""publication process"" involves a reading committee. The manuscript submitted by the researcher to the publisher for publication is then sent for review to peer-reviewers, specialists in the field, who assess the quality of the article (peer-reviewing). The manuscript may then be rejected, accepted as is, or accepted subject to modifications of varying degrees.

Predatory journals are a scam that offers researchers the opportunity to publish their work quickly and openly, often via email solicitations, in return for a publication fee. They present themselves as serious but offer no guarantee of scientific integrity and publish manuscripts without any form of evaluation or validation, simply for profit. There are more than 12,000 of them around the world, and researchers need to be increasingly vigilant. However, there is no agreed definition of a predatory journal, and some initiatives offer non-exhaustive lists of scientific journals presumed to be predatory, such as Beall's List, or non-predatory, such as that of Sorbonne University.",1.0,12.831111111111113,False,True,0.690291166305542,0.5561276078224182,b,False,5,1

- Migraine is a neurovascular pathology linked to subtle neuronal and vascular alterations. The mechanisms are still incompletely understood.

- Migraines come in two varieties:
  - Migraine without aura (MSA): 6-10% of the population
  - Migraine with aura: The headache is preceded or accompanied by transient neurological symptoms (3-6% of the population).

- Migraine disease is a neurovascular pathology:
  - Polygenic hereditary: Multiple susceptibility genes induce cerebral hyperexcitability and dysfunction of cephalic nociception modulator centers.
  - Environmental factors: Pathology of adaptation to change includes internal or external triggers that disrupt cerebral homeostasis, such as changes to meals or sleep, unusual physical effort, climatic changes, catamenial period, stress, or positive or negative emotion.
  - Young people: 90% of attacks begin under the age of 40, and migraine is rare over the age of 65.
  - Predominantly female: After puberty, estrogen impregnation increases cerebral excitability, and variations during the cycle make attacks more likely. Migraines typically improve during pregnancy and after menopause.
  - Paroxysmal and cyclic with 5 phases: Prodrome, aura, headache, post-drome, and interictal phase.

- Prodromes: Activation of the hypothalamus can last up to 48 hours before the headache, leading to a lifting of inhibition of the brainstem and trigeminovascular system.

- Migraine aura: Wave of pervasive cortical depression (PCD) with moderate vasoconstriction.

- Migraine headache is caused by activation of the trigemino-vascular system and a major role for CGRP (calcitonin-gene related peptide) with perivascular and meningeal aseptic inflammation and moderate vasodilation.",1.0,20.697777777777777,False,True,0.816500186920166,0.6655293703079224,b,False,2,3

- Notify the doctor in charge or the hospital's operational hygiene team (if a healthcare establishment).
- Identify patients who have or had clinical signs.
- For each patient, document a list of symptoms, the date and time of their onset, and a list of meals eaten over the last three days.
- Keep leftovers of raw materials and food served to the community over the last three days (keep refrigerated, not frozen).
- Take stool samples and possibly vomit samples from patients.
- Prepare a list of meal menus for the last three days.
- Report any suspected CFTI to the ARS medical inspector or, if unavailable, to the veterinary food hygiene service.

**Investigation by ARS Medical Inspectors**

1. **Epidemiological Survey**  
   - Calculation of attack rates and distribution of cases as a function of time and space.
   - Verification of hypotheses through investigation.
   - For communities with fewer than 30 exposed people, a cohort study is conducted. For communities with more than 30, a case-control study is performed.

2. **Microbiological Investigation**  
   - Samples are taken from the presumed source (communities must keep a control meal from the previous three days) for microbiological and toxicological analysis.
   - Sampling of pathological products from affected patients (stools, vomit, blood, etc.).

Medication-abuse headache (MAC) ""Suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or care (SD-348)"" is a headache occurring at least 15 days/month in the context of overuse of crisis treatments for more than 3 months in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache, either tension headache or migraine.

- Opiates and combined analgesics confer the highest risk of CAM.
- Overuse of analgesics may be a consequence or a cause of the increased frequency of headaches, or both.

The role of overuse of analgesics in the onset of chronic migraine should not be overestimated, as this attitude can lead to patients being stigmatized as being responsible for their illness and to withdrawal being favored as the sole treatment to the detriment of other, more effective therapeutic solutions.

Chronic migraine may be diagnosed with associated drug abuse.

CAM prevention is based on:

- Proper diagnosis of migraine and tension headache in general practice
- Prescription of recommended crisis treatments, avoiding opiates and combined analgesics
- Informing patients about the role of overuse of analgesics in the increase in headaches
- Advice to limit the number of days of crisis treatment to 2 days a week or 8 days a month
- The introduction of prophylaxis for the primary headache (usually migraine) when crisis treatment becomes frequent and the attacks disabling.

Discrimination in healthcare is not solely due to social perceptions or a lack of vigilance by healthcare providers. It involves systemic malfunctions, a failure to provide care, or a reduction in the quality of care.

Several structural and organizational factors have been identified and are listed in the Migration Sant√© Alsace publication ""Vers plus d'√©galit√© en sant√©: guide de pr√©vention et de lutte contre les discriminations"" (2019).

- **Asymmetrical Power Relationships in Care:** Patients may feel illegitimate and therefore refrain from asking questions or expressing their preferences.
  
- **Heterogeneous Practices:** Some care teams lack the necessary conditions to reflect on malfunctions that can lead to discrimination.
  
- **Territorial Inequalities in Healthcare Provision:** In areas with healthcare desertification or shortages, refusal of care is not distributed equitably.
  
- **Lack of Coordination:** This can lead to some caregivers refusing to treat certain patients deemed more difficult to treat.
  
- **Insufficient Use of Professional Interpreters:** Despite the challenges of providing care without a common language, professional interpreters are underutilized.
  
- **Economic Logic in Tension with Care Objectives:** The pursuit of profitability can reinforce differential patient orientation, leading to poorer treatment for patients perceived as more complicated.

## Definitions

- Pain associated with an alteration in nociception despite the absence of evidence of a tissue lesion activating the nociceptors or a disease or lesion affecting the somato-sensory system.
- This is a group of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome.
- The pathophysiology of this pain is less well known than for other injury mechanisms.
- The most well-documented hypothesis is that they depend mainly on an alteration in ""pain control and modulation systems,"" with a reduction in inhibitory mechanisms and/or an increase in facilitatory mechanisms.

## Nociplastic Pain Syndromes

- Fibromyalgia
- Irritable bowel syndrome (chronic abdominal pain - at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months - related to defecation, with changes in stool frequency or appearance; present for at least 6 months)
- Cystalgia with clear urine (urinary urgency)
- Temporomandibular joint syndrome
- Primary headaches
- Complex regional pain syndrome type I (algodystrophy)

## Explaining Nociplastic Pain to the Patient

- Explain to patients that it is a ""pain control defect or dysregulation,"" a central neurological disorder of the pain pathways, sometimes with an identified contributing factor (physical or psychological trauma), on a pre-existing genetic or psychological background.
- Patients should be informed that ""treatment should not be limited to medication,"" but should always combine a physical and psychological approach, whatever the cause or context.
- Once the diagnosis has been made, information should be provided in writing, and ""regular, gentle physical exercise"" should be recommended as a first-line treatment, particularly in cases of fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, and temporomandibular joint syndrome.

## Fibromyalgia

- Fibromyalgia (FM) is common (1.6% of the population) and affects women at least twice as often as men.
- It is the most frequent chronic diffuse pain pathology and one of the most common types of non-disciplinary pain (along with irritable bowel syndrome).
- Many pathologies can mimic and/or be associated with FM (RA, SpA, Lupus, osteoarthritis, small-fibre neuropathy, etc.).
- There are practical questionnaires for screening and diagnosing fibromyalgia, in particular the simple, validated FiRST questionnaire.

### ACR Criteria (Revised in 2016)

- Diffuse pain affecting at least 4 out of 5 areas of the body
- Symptoms for at least 3 months
- Diffuse Pain Index (DPI) (0-19) and Symptom Severity Scale (SS) (0-12): based on the presence and intensity of the following symptoms: fatigue (0-3), waking up without rest (0-3), cognitive impairment (0-3) and, in the last 6 months: headaches (0-1), abdominal pain/cramps (0-1) and depression (0-1).
- The diagnosis is made if the combination of IDD > 7 and SS > 5 or the combination of IDD between 4 and 6 and SS > 9.

### Associated Symptoms

- Frequent associated somatic symptoms: asthenia, sleep disorders, tension headaches, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, restless legs syndrome, urinary urgency.
- Frequent associated psychological and cognitive symptoms: anxiety and depressive disorders, post-traumatic stress, hypervigilance (excessive focus on pain), neuroticism (tendency to express negative emotions), feelings of injustice, inflexible coping strategies, catastrophism, concentration/attention and memory problems, etc.

### Complementary Examinations

- Must be limited: CBC platelets, CRP, Ionogram TSH, PTH, Vit D, autoantibodies if clinically indicated, no X-rays.

### Treatment

- Must be multimodal: provide the diagnosis and integrate multidisciplinary approaches with the patient's involvement, without giving false hope of magical results.
- Non-medicinal treatments: to be offered as first-line treatment: adapted physical activity, cognitive and behavioral approaches (in the case of adjustment difficulties), relaxation/hypnosis/mindfulness meditation techniques, etc.
- Recommended drug treatments similar to those for neuropathic pain: antidepressants (tricyclics, SNRIs) and antiepileptics (gabapentin, pregabalin, the latter with caution): 30-40% improvement in 40% of patients.
- Level 1 or 2 analgesics: not very effective.
- Strong opioids, corticoids, benzodiazepines: strongly inadvisable.
- Risk of abuse and misuse for tramadol and pregabalin.

### FiRST Questionnaire

A positive response to 5 out of 6 items leads to a diagnosis of fibromyalgia with a sensitivity and specificity of 85%.

**Rubric:** Definition  

**Basics of Genetic Counselling**

Genetic counselling involves informing the patient and/or parents and/or family members about the risk of occurrence or recurrence of a genetic disease. It is the process by which patients or relatives at risk of a hereditary disease are advised and informed about:

- The nature and consequences of the disease
- The likelihood of developing it or passing it on to their offspring
- The options available for life and family planning to prevent illness or improve their situation

This process can be broken down into two parts: diagnosis (risk assessment) and a second, more complex part involving advice based on the diagnosis.

Genetic counselling can take place:

- Before conception (when one or both parents are carriers of a certain genetic trait or when a relative has a genetic disease)
- During pregnancy (if an abnormality is detected on ultrasound or if a risk of genetic disease is identified; risk of trisomy 21 following screening, for example)
- After birth (if a congenital disorder or malformation is found)
- During childhood (if the child shows signs of developmental delay)
- In adulthood (for genetic diseases that manifest in adulthood, such as Huntington's disease or hereditary cancers)
- Post-mortem for family members

Since 2011, in France, the Bioethics Act on information to relatives stipulates that the doctor or genetic counsellor must inform the patient/parents, prior to the genetic examination, that if a genetic anomaly is found, they must inform the family members potentially concerned.

**Possibilities of Prenatal Diagnosis (Management Methods and Options in the Case of a Particularly Serious Disease)**

Prenatal diagnosis is part of foetal medicine. It involves examinations carried out on pregnant women to diagnose a disease (infectious, haematological, genetic, etc.) in the foetus.

If a risk has already been identified in the family, the couple can decide on:

- The absence of any particular action and the assumption of the stated risk
- Adoption
- A request for prenatal diagnosis
- A request for pre-implantation diagnosis

Antenatal diagnosis can also be carried out following the identification of an anomaly during pregnancy monitoring (biological or ultrasound). The couple's proposal for an examination is discussed at the CPDPN (Multidisciplinary Centre for Prenatal Diagnosis). The couple is then offered genetic tests, which require invasive sampling to collect foetal material (cells, DNA), most often by chorionic villus puncture or amniocentesis.

- Fetal karyotype if an abnormality in chromosome number is suspected
- Chromosomal analysis on a DNA chip (ACPA or CGH array) in cases of suspected unbalanced chromosomal abnormality other than an abnormal number
- Targeted sequencing/analysis in cases of suspected gene syndrome or genetic disease identified in the family
- Some centres are beginning to offer exome testing in cases where there is a suspicion of a gene syndrome but no clear indication

If a woman is diagnosed with a particularly serious illness that is incurable at the time of diagnosis, she may request a medical termination of pregnancy (IMG) on medical grounds, regardless of the term. This request is discussed at a CPDPN and may be accepted if the illness meets the two criteria mentioned above:

- Particular gravity
- Incurable at the time of diagnosis

The CPDPN can also suggest drug therapies and, in rare cases, surgery to treat the foetus, as in the case of diaphragmatic hernia.

**Prenatal Screening for Trisomy 21**

Doctors must inform patients of the possibility of prenatal screening for trisomy 21, which is covered by the health insurance scheme. This screening must be preceded by information to the patient about trisomy 21 and the screening procedures, and requires her prior written consent. The screening process is not compulsory, and the patient may withdraw from the process at any time.

Screening enables a risk to be assessed but does not provide a definitive diagnosis. In the event of positive screening, the definitive diagnosis will be made by carrying out a foetal karyotype.

In the event of a confirmed diagnosis of trisomy 21, it is essential to arrange a systematic consultation with a geneticist to provide information on the prognosis and genetic counselling, prior to any decision to terminate a pregnancy for medical reasons, even if the parents decide to do so in advance.",1.0,9.96,False,True,0.7708747386932373,0.6496753891309103,c,True,5,2

**Definitions**

Prematurity is defined as birth before 37 weeks' amenorrhea (SA) and, from 22 SA, of a child weighing at least 500g.

A distinction is traditionally made between spontaneous prematurity (occurring spontaneously, without medical intervention or escaping tocolytic treatment) and induced prematurity (induced labor or cesarean section). In France, half of premature births are due to spontaneous prematurity (spontaneous labor or premature rupture of the membranes) and the other half to induced prematurity.

Spontaneous prematurity occurs after spontaneous labor with intact membranes (e.g., uterine contraction in a pregnant woman, pelvic pain) or after premature rupture of the membranes (e.g., loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman). Induced prematurity is linked to a fetal or maternal pathology leading voluntarily to birth through medical intervention.

The main causes of induced prematurity are pre-eclampsia (e.g., hypertension during pregnancy and proteinuria), IUGR, hypertension during pregnancy, retroplacental hematoma, and maternal pathologies requiring the birth of the child (e.g., respiratory insufficiency, acute respiratory distress, decompensated heart disease).

Patients with preterm rupture of membranes may also have an induced delivery if the condition of the newborn or the mother requires induction of labor or a cesarean section. There are many risk factors for spontaneous prematurity.

**Risk Factors**

- **Socio-demographic Risk Factors:**
  - Single, low socio-economic level (e.g., precarious social situation and isolation), inconsistent follow-up
  - Tobacco, alcohol, drugs
  - Stress, anxiety, depression, prolonged standing job
  - History of premature delivery and late miscarriage
  - Short interval between last two pregnancies
  - IVF (e.g., difficulty having children)

- **Risk Factors for Prematurity Linked to the Uterine Environment:**
  - Amnio-chorion infection
  - In the event of early premature rupture of the membranes, the risk of amnio-chorion infection is greatly increased.
  - Uterine malformations (e.g., discovery of a genital tract malformation)
  - Cervico-isthmic incompetence (classically defined as a functional mechanical disorder of the cervix resulting in late miscarriage)
  - Conization
  - Placental anomaly (placenta inserted low)
  - Breakthrough bleeding

- Hyponatremia reflects plasma hypo-osmolality (POsm < 280 mOsm/kg). It is therefore the consequence of excess water. It is associated with intracellular hyperhydration (ICH). The increase in intracellular volume is due to a transfer of water from the extracellular sector to the intracellular sector as a result of plasma hypo-osmolality. Hyponatremia associated with plasma hypo-osmolality is explained by a relative water content higher than the sodium stock, which may be normal (pure HIC), increased (HIC + HEC = global hyperhydration), or decreased (HIC + DEC).

== General ==

A bullous dermatosis should be suspected clinically in the presence of skin lesions such as bullae, post-bullous erosion, wet-linen detachment, and Nikolsky's sign (detachment of the epidermis on rubbing the peri-lesional normal skin).

The medical approach to bullous dermatosis should always distinguish between autoimmune mechanisms and all other causes of bullous dermatosis.

There are two places in the skin where a bubble can form: a bubble is intra-epidermal when the cleavage occurs in the epidermis (roof and floor of the bubble in the epidermis) and a bubble is sub-epidermal when there is a cleavage under the epidermis (roof of the bubble consisting of the entire epidermis and floor in the dermis).

The subepidermal bulla is usually taut, and the intraepidermal bulla is flaccid and fragile.

Autoimmune bullous dermatosis is a disease defined by the presence of immunoglobulins deposited at the dermo-epidermal junction or on the surface of keratinocytes.

Among all the data collected, it is necessary to isolate precisely:

* The **primary endpoint**: The relevance of this endpoint is judged by assessing its appropriateness to the study's primary objective and must meet a consensus definition. Relevance is also judged by the clinical significance of the endpoint. Criteria such as mortality, quality of life, occurrence of complications, etc., are of significant clinical relevance, but it is not always feasible to collect the most clinically relevant criterion.

  In accordance with article 226-14 of the French Penal Code, a doctor may report to the Public Prosecutor without the consent of an adult victim who is unable to protect themselves, in cases of serious acts requiring measures solely to protect the victim.

- **Mandat de Protection Future**  
  Any adult or emancipated minor (principal) not under guardianship or family power of attorney may appoint one or more persons (agent) in advance to represent them. When the principal is no longer capable of managing their interests, the authorised representative can protect the principal's personal and/or property interests.

The depressive patient may present with psychomotor slowdown, resulting in slowness in walking.

Subjects with a gait disorder of conversive (psychogenic) origin sometimes exhibit a very characteristic presentation with a ""bouncing"" or robotic-looking gait. Diagnosis is usually difficult and requires a thorough knowledge of the clinical expression of the different types of gait disorder. Clues in favor of a psychogenic disorder include:

- Sudden onset, spontaneous remission, or paroxysmal onset
- Time inconsistency
- Inconsistency of clinical expression with the characteristics of a disorder of neurological origin
- Spontaneous modification of the disorder, incompatible with the anomaly initially observed
- Disappearance of the disorder by distraction maneuvers. Conversely, the disorder increases when the subject's attention is focused on walking.
- Response to placebo, suggestion, or psychotherapy

**Title:** Know the Mechanisms and Pathophysiological Consequences of MI, IA, RA, MR

**Mitral Insufficiency:** Its importance and clinical consequences depend on the size of the regurgitant orifice, the filling pressures of the LV, and the acute or chronic nature of the leak.

- **Mechanisms: Carpentier Classification:**
  - Type I: Closure in the plane of the annulus/normal valve movement: perforation, annular dilation, etc.
  - Type II: Closure of the leaflets beyond the plane of the annulus: prolapse, rupture of cordage, etc.
  - Type III: Closure of the leaflets downstream of the plane of the annulus towards the LV (tenting) with restriction of movement of the valve leaflets in systole for functional leaks, in systole and diastole for organic leaks: rheumatic, anorexigenic, etc.

- **Physiopathological Consequences:**
  - Acute MI: Sudden increase in preload and pressure in the slightly dilated OG, sudden post-capillary PAH with acute pulmonary oedema (APO).
  - Chronic MI: LV dilatation and hyperkinesia (Starling's law), reduction in afterload due to systolic ejection into the OG, dilatation of the OG, with delayed onset of PAH and clinical signs.

**Aortic Stenosis:** Classically slow progression, the most common valvulopathy in developed countries.

- **Mechanisms:** Degeneration with calcification and fibrosis of the valve leaflets impairing systolic ejection.

- **Physiopathological Consequences:**
  - Increase in afterload due to increase in LV-to-aorta gradient.
  - Adaptation of the left ventricle: concentric hypertrophy (LVH) without dilatation.
  - Relaxation disorder with diastolic heart failure and late impairment of contractility.
  - Functional coronary insufficiency.

**Aortic Insufficiency:** The severity of the leak depends on the size of the regurgitant orifice and the duration of diastole.

- **Mechanisms:** By anomaly of the aortic root or by damage to the valve.

- **Physiopathological Consequences:**
  - Acute AI:
    - Abrupt LV overload (volume + pressure) due to relative increase in afterload.
    - Sudden increase in preload and decrease in coronary flow.
  - Chronic AI:
    - LV dilatation due to volume overload associated with moderate LVH due to increase in systolic ejection volume (SEV).
    - Eventual fibrosis and LV dysfunction.
    - Increase in systolic BP, decrease in diastolic BP, arterial hyperpulsatility due to peripheral hyperflow.

**Mitral Re-Narrowing:** Valvulopathy which has become rare in industrialized countries because it is most often of rheumatic origin.

- **Mechanisms:** Commissural fusion plus lesions of the subvalvular apparatus and/or calcifications of the annulus impeding valve opening and narrowing the mitral orifice.

- **Physiopathological Consequences:**
  - Obstruction between the OG and the VG: Significant dilatation of the OG allowing pressure damping but resulting in a high risk of AF and thromboembolic complications.

Before the abortion:

- Two compulsory consultations
- A psycho-social interview is mandatory for all patients and is compulsory for minors.

Abortion is an exception to the coordinated care pathway, allowing patients to consult a doctor other than their GP. It is not necessary to see your GP before a consultation. Access to a gynaecologist or midwife is unrestricted. Abortions can also be performed by GPs in private practices up to 9 weeks' gestation.

**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

## Neurophysiological Bases of Pain

- Pain plays a major physiological role in protecting the body's integrity.
- The general neurophysiological organization of the nociceptive system underlying pain perception is similar to that of other sensory systems.

### Detection

- Nociceptive stimuli, potentially dangerous to the body, are detected by peripheral receptors called ""nociceptors.""
- Nociceptors are free endings of small-diameter peripheral nerve fibers called Adelta and C fibers, located throughout the body's tissues (skin, muscles, joints, viscera).
- Nociceptive messages are generated by molecules called ""transducers,"" located on the surface of the endings of the Adelta and C fibers.

### Transmission

- After traveling through the peripheral nerves, the Adelta and C fibers join the central nervous system via the posterior spinal roots and project to the posterior horn of the spinal cord.
- Nociceptive neurons located in the posterior horn of the spinal cord then transmit these messages to the brain.
- Most of the axons of the nociceptive neurons in the posterior horn of the spinal cord cross the median line to join the spinothalamic bundle.
- Part of this bundle, which projects to the lateral thalamus and then to the primary and secondary somaesthetic cortices, is more involved in the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain.
- A second part, which projects onto the medial thalamus and then the cingulate and insular cortex (limbic cortex), is more involved in the emotional aspects of pain.
- Medullary nociceptive neurons also project to bulbar and pontoencephalic relays involved in the cognitive (fear, anticipation, memory of nociceptive damage), behavioral (escape, immobilization, defense, attack), or neuroendocrine (release of stress hormones) reactions associated with pain.

The ascending routes are depicted in Figure 1.

### Segmental and Supra-segmental Modulation

- Powerful control mechanisms enable nociceptive information generated in the periphery to be extracted, integrated, and modulated.
- Segmental modulation mechanisms acting in the spinal cord are based on the inhibition of small diameter fibers (nociceptors) by the simultaneous activation of large diameter fibers. This discovery led to the use of transcutaneous electrical stimulation and spinal cord electrical stimulation to treat certain types of pain.
- Supra-segmental modulation mechanisms originate in brain structures, particularly in the brainstem (periaqueductal grey matter, raphe nuclei, etc.) and involve different neurotransmitter systems such as the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems.
- They are also called ""descending controls"" because they can modulate, either by inhibiting or facilitating, the activity of the nociceptive neurons in the spinal cord in a very powerful way.
- These modulation systems account for classic clinical observations such as the absence of a direct relationship between the size of a lesion and the resulting pain and, more generally, the influence of psychological, cognitive, contextual, and cultural factors on the experience of pain.
- Alterations or dysfunctions in these systems are involved in the pathophysiology of many chronic pain syndromes.

Figure 1 illustrates supra-segmental modulation (inhibitory controls from the brainstem).

## Pathophysiological Elements

- Classically, we distinguish three main types of pain on a physiopathological basis, even if certain mechanisms (particularly central) are common to these different types of pain. These main types of pain may be associated (e.g., postoperative pain which is typically nociceptive but frequently associated with a neuropathic component).

### Pain Caused by Excessive Nociceptive Stimulation (Nociceptive Pain)

- These pains, secondary to various tissue lesions (trauma, burns, infection, malignant processes, etc.), are the most frequent in clinical practice.
- In this case, the nociceptive systems are intact and are linked to the overstimulation of these systems, notably due to the inflammatory reactions frequently observed in this context.
- Visceral pain related to distension of cavities or spasm of smooth muscles (e.g., gastroenteritis, colitis, renal colic, hepatic colic, etc.) is related to pain caused by excess nociception (stretching of the walls, often associated with parietal inflammation, etc.).
- Inflammatory processes lead to hyperactivation of the nociceptors (peripheral sensitization) linked to the action of a large number of pro-nociceptive substances (bradykinin, H+ ions, prostaglandins, histamine, substance P, NGF, etc.) released during inflammation and liable to directly activate or sensitize the nociceptors.
- Under conditions of inflammation, nociceptors that are normally silent when not stimulated become spontaneously active, and their evoked responses are increased and appear with a lower threshold.
- These peripheral mechanisms can secondarily induce central modifications consisting mainly of phenomena of central sensitization and alterations in modulation systems, which play a decisive role in the perpetuation of certain types of pain and explain certain therapeutic failures aimed solely at acting on peripheral factors.
- The mechanisms of central sensitization are complex. They involve NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) receptors, the activation of which is linked to the significant increase in the central release of glutamate due to the prolonged activation and sensitization of nociceptors.
- The cascade of intracellular events triggered by the activation of these NMDA receptors is at the origin of a long-lasting hyperexcitability of central nociceptive neurons (central sensitization) which contributes to increasing and amplifying the pain and could account for the transformation of certain acute pains into chronic pains.

### Neuropathic Pain

- Linked to lesions or diseases of the somato-sensory system and in particular the nociceptive system, they are most often associated with a sensory deficit (deafferentation) and cannot be explained by simple overstimulation of the nociceptors.
- They depend on secondary peripheral and central mechanisms that help to amplify and perpetuate the pain.
- One of the most well-documented peripheral mechanisms is the appearance of ectopic discharges, i.e., electrical activity (action potentials) which originate aberrantly at the nerve lesion. These foci of abnormal discharges result from the accumulation at the lesion site of dysfunctional ion channels, in particular, certain subtypes of specific sodium channels, whose physiological role is to regulate membrane excitability.
- The profound metabolic changes associated with nerve damage are responsible for a reduction or increase in the synthesis and release of various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides (glutamate, substance P, BDNF, etc.) which are responsible for secondary central changes.
- The central mechanisms are mainly: the development of central sensitization phenomena, alterations in modulation systems, or neuroplasticity (reorganization of somato-sensory systems) which contribute to amplifying and perpetuating pain.

### Nociplastic (or Dysfunctional) Pain

- This is a group of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome, characterized by the absence of an identifiable lesion likely to explain the pain.
- The pathophysiology of these pains is less well known, but the best-documented hypothesis at present is that they depend mainly on alterations in pain control and modulation systems, with a reduction in inhibitory mechanisms and/or an increase in facilitatory mechanisms.",0.6,9.255714285714287,False,True,0.6734769940376282,0.6509202718734741,c,False,2,4

The ""ticket mod√©rateur"" is the proportion of the cost of treatment that remains payable by the insured person after reimbursement by the health insurance scheme. Its aim is to regulate healthcare consumption by making patients financially responsible. The co-payment may be covered in full or in part by private insurance or a complementary mutual insurance company. It has existed since the creation of the French social security system and applies to all reimbursable healthcare costs: consultations with a doctor, medical biology tests, radiology examinations, the purchase of prescribed drugs, etc.

The percentage of the co-payment varies according to:

- The nature of the risk (illness, maternity, disability, industrial accident/occupational disease).

- Whether or not you are following the coordinated care pathway.

For example, if you consult your GP (a general practitioner in sector 1), the consultation rate used as a basis for reimbursement is ‚Ç¨25.

- Of this amount, the Assurance Maladie will reimburse 70%, i.e., ‚Ç¨17.50.
- The co-payment is 30%, i.e., ‚Ç¨7.50.
- However, you will have to pay a fixed contribution of ‚Ç¨1.
- Your total out-of-pocket expenses are therefore ‚Ç¨7.50 + ‚Ç¨1, i.e., ‚Ç¨8.50.

A ""fixed contribution"" of ‚Ç¨1 is charged for each consultation (see example above), biological analysis, or radiology procedure, up to a maximum of ‚Ç¨50 per year. Patients under the age of 18, beneficiaries of complementary health insurance, beneficiaries of the AME, and pregnant women from the sixth month of pregnancy are exempt from the fixed contribution.

An ""excess"" is deducted from patient reimbursements and applies to: medicines (‚Ç¨0.50 per box), paramedical procedures (‚Ç¨0.50 per procedure), and medical transport (‚Ç¨2 per transport).

The excess is capped at 50 euros per year in total and cannot exceed 2 euros per day for paramedical procedures and 4 euros per day for medical transport.

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

== Optic Nerve Damage ==

=== Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy (NOIA) ===

NOIA is caused by acute ischaemia of the optic nerve head due to occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries (PCA) or their branches. It is characterized by a sudden unilateral drop in visual acuity, associated with papilledema and visual field damage, typically in the form of an altitudinal deficit.

Horton's disease or gigantocellular arteritis (also known as arteritic optic neuropathy) should be considered first due to the need for systemic corticosteroids to be administered urgently. A systematic search should be made for evidence of Horton's disease: systemic signs of the disease, changes in the temporal arteries, suggestive ocular signs (episodes of fleeting amaurosis preceding the onset of NOIA, choroidal filling defect on fundus angiography indicative of choroidal ischaemia), biological signs (accelerated sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein), and temporal artery biopsy (should be performed as soon as possible, but there is no reason to wait for it before starting corticosteroid therapy). The risk of bilateralization and complete, bilateral, permanent blindness means that any suspected case of Horton's disease must be treated with high-dose corticosteroids urgently.

Arteriosclerosis (also known as non-arteritic optic neuropathy) is the most common cause of NOIA, due to occlusion of the PCAs or one of their branches by in situ thrombosis. Risk factors generally include smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.

The differential diagnosis includes other causes of papilledema.

=== Papilledema ===

This is a swelling of the optic nerve head following an increase in intracranial pressure. In the presence of papilledema, malignant arterial hypertension (if bilateral) and intracranial hypertension (if bilateral) should be ruled out, followed by inflammatory optic neuropathy.

Symptoms of intracranial hypertension include headache, nausea/vomiting, transient visual disturbances such as visual eclipses, and VI nerve paralysis. Initially, there is no loss of visual acuity and no visual field abnormalities other than enlargement of blind spots.

In cases of inflammatory optic neuritis with papillitis, visual acuity is predominantly impaired.

=== Retro-bulbar Optic Neuritis (RBON) ===

Damage is often rapidly progressive (over a few hours to a few days) and can cause a drop in visual acuity of varying severity. This is associated with the appearance of a scotoma, usually central or caecocentral. Visual impairment is often accompanied by retro-orbital pain, which increases when the eyeballs are moved. Retrobulbar optic neuritis should be investigated first and foremost for multiple sclerosis, which is the main cause, particularly in young patients.

Other causes of optic nerve damage include:

- Toxic and drug-induced optic neuropathies: These neuropathies are bilateral and progressive. They are dominated by four causes: ethylic optic neuropathy, optic neuropathies related to anti-tuberculosis treatments (ethambutol and isoniazid), occupational optic neuropathies (e.g., lead), and metabolic optic neuropathies (diabetes).

- Tumoral optic neuropathies, linked to intra-orbital tumors or tumors in the anterior part of the skull (sphenoid meningioma, etc.).

== Damage to the Optic Chiasm ==

Compression of the optic pathways at the level of the chiasma results in a very specific aspect of the visual field known as ""chiasmatic syndrome,"" which, in its typical form, results in a bitemporal hemianopia, i.e., a deficit in the temporal hemifields (corresponding to damage to the nasal fibers which decussate at the level of the chiasma). Sometimes the compression is partial (particularly in the early stages) and a bitemporal quadranopsia is observed.

In terms of aetiology, the main cause of chiasmatic syndrome is pituitary adenoma. Chiasmatic syndrome is often progressive in onset, beginning with superior bitemporal quadranopsia.

== Retrochiasmatic Disease ==

This results in a sensory deficit in one hemifield, right or left (the same on both sides), called homonymous lateral hemianopia, with the deficit on the opposite side to the lesion. Damage to the optic radiations, where the upper and lower fibers travel in two clearly separated bundles, is more likely to result in homonymous lateral quadranopsia, usually superior.

In terms of aetiology, there are three main causes: vascular (stroke, compressive hematoma), tumor, and trauma.

A sudden onset of hemianopsia or homonymous lateral quadranopsia caused by damage to the retrochiasmatic optic pathways suggests a vascular etiology, whereas a progressive onset suggests a tumor etiology.",0.8,16.710769230769234,False,True,0.6518269777297974,0.5765627225240072,c,False,2,4

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) most often appears in healthy areas without precancerous lesions. Its appearance is polymorphic, with lesions generally consisting of translucent pearly papules of firm consistency associated with telangiectasias. The pearls vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters.

There are three clinical forms:

- **Nodular BCC:** A translucent papule or nodule covered with telangiectasia, which includes planar scarring BCC (a plaque of variable size with a progressive spread, a whitish atrophocicatricial center, and a peripheral pearly border).
- **Superficial BCC:** A thin plaque with a pearly border or a well-limited erythematosquamous plaque occurring preferentially on the trunk.
- **Sclerodermiform BCC:** A yellowish-white, hard, poorly limited plaque.

In these forms, there may be associated ulceration and/or pigmentation.

BCC is a slowly progressing tumor of purely local malignancy, which may progressively extend into neighboring tissues, particularly along embryonic fusion planes and nerve sheaths. Metastatic forms are exceptional.

Squamous Cell Carcinoma (EC) often starts on predisposing skin lesions:

- **Actinic Keratosis (Seniles):** Red, keratotic, rough patches that bleed after removal, multiple on exposed areas, sometimes confluent, and non-healing.
- **Chronic Inflammatory Lesions:**
  - Radiodermatitis
  - Chronic leg ulcers
  - Cheilitis
  - Burn scars
  - Leukoplakia

EC can occur on the skin, mucous membranes, and semi-mucous membranes.

There are two main forms of EC:

- **In situ EC or Bowen's Disease:** Usually a single, fixed lesion in a photo-exposed area, erythematous or pinkish, possibly pigmented, well-defined, and squamous-crusted.

If carcinoma is suspected, a biopsy should be taken, and an anatomopathological examination should be carried out to confirm the diagnosis.

The clinical examination must include:

- The search for other carcinomas and/or melanomas over the whole skin.
- Search for adenopathy in the drainage area (EC).

There is no indication for a systematic extension work-up unless the form is aggressive, the patient is at particular risk (e.g., immunocompromised), or there are clinical signs of loco-regional extension, which may require lymph node ultrasound, thoraco-abdominal CT scan, or PET scan.",0.6666666666666666,11.784285714285716,False,True,0.8167250156402588,0.6949259042739868,b,True,4,3

Acute lung oedema occurs when plasma fluid diffuses into the extravascular pulmonary spaces (interstitium, alveolus).

There are two types:

**Lesional oedema due to alteration of the alveolar-capillary membrane**  
- Linked to an increase in permeability due to damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane.
- Pulmonary capillary pressure is normal or low (< 18 mmHg).
- The oedema fluid has a very high protein content, close to that of plasma.
- This is responsible for acute respiratory failure, which can progress to interstitial fibrosis, known as ARDS.

**Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema due to pulmonary capillary hyperpressure**  
- Sudden or chronic increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).
- In the normal state, the PCP is of the order of 7-12 mmHg and the oncotic pressure is 25 mmHg.
- Above 25 mmHg, there is extravasation of fluid into the interstitial tissue and then into the alveolus, leading to haematosis disorders with hypoxaemia and a reduction in lung compliance.

**Description:** Definition of the different types of spa treatment and how they work  
**Rubric:** Definition  

Every year, almost 600,000 patients undergo a spa treatment in France.

== Definitions of a Spa Treatment ==  
All therapies applied to a patient during their stay in a spa, including crenotherapy, rest, a change of scenery, climate, and possibly non-thermal treatments (functional rehabilitation, therapeutic education). Do not confuse thermal medicine with hydrotherapy (external use of any water, regardless of its physical or chemical composition) or thalassotherapy (use of seawater without systematic medical supervision; neither recognized nor reimbursed by Health Insurance) or Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine.

== Waters Used in Thermal Medicine ==  
They are classified according to their temperature (thermality) and their chemical composition (minerality). The ""thermality"" separates ""cold"" waters (8 to 15¬∞C, mainly for diuresis cures), ""mesothermal"" waters (25 to 34¬∞C, for prolonged baths), and ""hyperthermal"" waters (inhalation, study, shower, bath). The ""mineralization"" (presence of a predominant ion) is constant for each source and enables mineral waters to be classified as:

- **Sulphur:** H2S, especially respiratory indications: sodic of the ""Pyrenean"" type or calcic
- **Sulphate:** Urinary and metabolic diseases, especially calcium and magnesium
- **Sodic Chlorides:** Rich in sodium
- **Gas Carbonates:** Sodium or calcium
- **With a Rare Element:** Arsenic, iron, copper, selenium
- **Low Mineral Content:** Trace metals

Note: Mineral waters are unstable, losing their characteristics after a few hours, which is why it is necessary to take the water from the source (""griffon"") and to carry out the treatment on site. Other thermal agents include thermal plankton, thermal gases (CO2, H2S), and mud (peloids).

== Thermal Techniques with Three Main Types of Cures ==  

1. **Internal Hydrotherapy:** Based on drinking cures (taking 100 to 300 ml/day of thermal water) used in all resorts. Diuresis cures (up to 3 liters per day) are used for digestive, urinary, or metabolic disorders.
2. **Contact Cures:** Application of the thermal agent in contact with the skin or mucous membranes. For respiratory ailments: inhalations, aerosols, balneotherapy, nasal baths, sinus cleansing, etc.
3. **External Hydrotherapy:** Uses the physical characteristics of water: baths (in a pool or bathtub, hot or warm), showers (local, regional, or general, of varying temperature, pressure, and duration) for sedative or analgesic purposes, hand or foot baths.

Other thermal techniques include functional re-education, treatments not specific to thermal medicine (physiotherapy, postural drainage, and respiratory re-education), and health education, for which thermal cures are an ideal place.

== Spa Resorts in France ==  
Around a hundred spa resorts in France: firstly in Occitanie (200,000 spa visitors/year), then in Nouvelle Aquitaine (150,000 spa visitors/year) and Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes (130,000 spa visitors/year). The three main resorts are Balaruc (RH, PHL), Dax (RH, PHL), and Gr√©oux (RH, VR).

== Indications for Spa Treatment ==  
Chronic pathologies, incompletely improved. The majority of cures are for rheumatology (3/4), followed by the respiratory tract (1/10) and phlebology (1/20). One of the characteristics is the specialization in the treatment of certain conditions (due to the principle of the specificity of mineral waters). There are 12 therapeutic orientations for spas recognized by the French social security system, and spas may have two (exceptionally three) therapeutic orientations.

- **RH:** Rheumatology and sequelae of osteo-articular trauma
- **Respiratory Tract Diseases:** ENT or pneumology
- **MCA:** Cardio-Arterial Diseases
- **AU:** Diseases of the Urinary System and Metabolic Diseases
- **AD:** Diseases of the Digestive System and Metabolic Diseases
- **PHL:** Phlebology
- **GYN:** Gynaecology
- **DER:** Dermatology
- **AMB:** Oral and lingual mucosal diseases
- **NEU:** Neurology
- **PSY:** Psychosomatic disorders
- **TDE:** Troubles du D√©veloppement de l'Enfant (Anomaly of psychomotor development)

Since the early 2000s, under the aegis of the AFRETH (Association Fran√ßaise de REcherche THermale - French Association for Thermal Research), several high-quality clinical trials have been carried out, demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of thermal medicine in its main indications. The most validated indications are rheumatology (osteoarthritis, chronic lumbago, inflammatory rheumatism outside flare-ups), followed by arteritis and psychiatry (generalized anxiety disorders).

== Undesirable Effects of Spa Treatments ==  
Very rare and often ""non-serious"": asthenia after a few days of treatment (""spa crisis""), complications of treatment techniques, etc.

== Contraindications to Spa Treatments ==  
Obvious non-indications such as infections, cancers, relapsing illnesses, recent cardiovascular diseases, immunodepression, etc.

== How to Prescribe a Spa Treatment ==  
The cure is prescribed by the attending physician on a special form to be sent to the Caisse d'AM with its two sections: prise en charge (completed by the prescribing physician) and d√©claration de ressources (completed by the insured person). The doctor must specify (using the key letter) the main indication (and any secondary indications). A course of treatment lasts three weeks. Reimbursed at 65% by SS (100% reimbursed if ALD, occupational disease, or work accident). Complementary medical practices (pharyngeal showers, Proetz displacement method in ENT, thermal gas injections for arteriopathy) are reimbursed at 70%.

The medical surveillance package includes three medical consultations: on arrival, in the middle, and at the end of the cure. Only one cure per year is reimbursed by Social Security.

**Title:** Knowing the definition of the different techniques for preserving female and male fertility (child, adolescent, adult)  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Definition  

There are several fertility preservation techniques, adapted to the age and sex/gender of patients, the gonadotoxic treatment envisaged (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery), the pathology that may impair fertility, and the general medical context of patients. It is important to warn patients that none of these techniques can guarantee a pregnancy.

In non-medical fertility preservation indications, only oocytes or sperm can be preserved (Bioethics Law 2021).

Prior to freezing, oocytes, spermatozoa, embryos, and germ tissue are packaged in tubes (germ tissue) or straws (oocytes, embryos, spermatozoa, and germ tissue) containing a cryoprotective medium. Frozen biological samples are stored in containers containing liquid nitrogen at -196¬∞C.

**Female Fertility Preservation Techniques**

In pubescent girls and women, two techniques are possible:

- Freezing or storage of mature oocytes or embryos, which requires prior hormonal stimulation. As with IVF, the ovaries are stimulated with hormones, and an ultrasound-guided oocyte puncture is then performed vaginally. The mature oocytes recovered can either be frozen and stored at -196¬∞C or used in fertilization for patients in couples who so wish, before freezing and storing the embryos.  
  - However, this oocyte or embryo freezing technique has several disadvantages:
    - It requires at least two weeks (stimulation and oocyte puncture): it is therefore not indicated in situations where potentially gonadotoxic treatment is required as a matter of extreme urgency.
    - It induces a supra-physiological increase in estradiol, which is potentially harmful in certain hormone-dependent diseases (e.g., hormone-dependent breast cancer).

- Freezing and storage of mature oocytes without prior hormonal stimulation. This is accompanied by prior in vitro maturation of immature oocytes. This involves puncturing the immature oocytes contained in the small antral follicles without injecting any hormone. The recovered oocytes are then matured ""in vitro"" in the laboratory for 24 to 48 hours. Only the oocytes that have matured are frozen or used for fertilization with a view to embryo freezing for patients in couples who so wish. This technique can be carried out as an emergency, regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle.

If the patient in a couple chooses to keep embryos, she will only be able to reuse them later as a couple and with the same living spouse (the embryo belongs to the couple whereas the oocyte belongs only to the patient).

It should be noted that the fertilization method for mature oocytes stored will necessarily be ICSI.

- Ovarian cortex freezing or preservation involves removing part of an ovary or an entire ovary, usually during laparoscopy. The cortex, containing the stock of primordial follicles, is isolated and then cut into fragments which are then frozen at -196¬∞C. For reuse, the fragments of ovarian cortex are grafted onto either the remaining ovary or the peritoneum. Autografting has the advantage of restoring endogenous hormone secretion as well as fertility. It has proved its effectiveness in humans, with more than 130 children born worldwide up to 2021 after an ovarian cortex autograft (spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies induced by IVF). The major risk of this transplant is, in the case of malignant pathologies, the ""reintroduction of the initial disease"" through the tumor cells present in the ovarian fragments. To avoid this risk, other reuse procedures are being developed and are still in the field of research (in vitro follicular maturation in the laboratory using primordial follicles from the preserved ovarian cortex or alternative grafting procedures using previously isolated primordial ovarian follicles).

In addition, injections of GnRH agonists aimed at ""resting"" the ovaries (to protect the pool of primordial follicles from the effects of chemotherapy) may be proposed, even if this has not been shown to be effective.

In addition, it is possible to propose ovarian transposition during pelvic radiotherapy in order to limit the gonadotoxic effects of ionizing radiation on the ovary.

In prepubescent girls, ovarian cortex freezing or conservation will be the only possible preservation technique.

**Male Fertility Preservation Techniques**

- In pubescent adolescents and adult men, freezing or preserving ejaculated spermatozoa is the technique most often used (sperm collected by masturbation in the laboratory).
- In prepubertal boys, there are no spermatozoa present in the testicles, only germ stem cells. Freezing or preserving testicular tissue may therefore be proposed. The possible future use of frozen testicular tissue is currently still in the field of research, with regard to ""in vitro"" spermatogenesis, testicular tissue grafting, and germ cell transplantation.",0.8571428571428571,15.725000000000005,False,True,0.778676450252533,0.7960340976715088,b,True,2,4

**Title:** Know How to Diagnose an Alveolar Syndrome  
**Description:** Recognize an alveolar opacity and an air bronchogram  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Definitions:** Imaging of abnormal filling of the pulmonary alveoli with dense material (transudate, exudate, blood, pus, etc.). The most common cause is acute microbial pneumonia (bacterial or viral), more commonly known as acute frank lobar pneumonia. Other causes include intra-alveolar hemorrhage, fluid and sodium overload, organized pneumonia, pneumonic lung cancer, etc.

The definition of alveolar syndrome in imaging is classically based on two criteria:
- Pulmonary opacity (denser or ""whiter"" than normal parenchyma)
- Containing images of aerated bronchi (aerated bronchogram)

The term ""systemic"" alveolar syndrome is used when a segment, lobe, or lung is affected. In a lobar alveolar syndrome, the abnormalities stop at the pulmonary scissure delimiting the affected lobe. The silhouette sign can help localize the opacity and its relationship with the mediastinum. The term ""retractile"" alveolar syndrome is used when there is a loss of volume in the lobe or lung concerned, which can be assessed by the displacement of the scissures, the pulmonary hilum, or the diaphragmatic dome. A proximal bronchial obstruction should be sought. If the loss of volume is significant, it is referred to as atelectasis.

CT imaging is more accurate than chest X-ray for diagnosing alveolar syndrome and investigating the cause. It can reveal ground-glass opacities that are difficult or impossible to see on X-ray and look for complications such as pulmonary abscesses or pleural empyema. Only a typical chest X-ray in a patient with a strong suspicion of PFLA or acute pulmonary edema may be sufficient for diagnosis; in all other cases, a CT scan will be necessary.

**Special Presentations:**
- Acute lobar frank pneumonia: Non-retractable systematized alveolar syndrome in a patient with fever and cough.
- Some bacterial, fungal, or viral pneumonias may present as multiple poorly limited alveolar opacities.
- Acute pulmonary edema: Bilateral, symmetrical, peri-hilar alveolar syndrome, often associated with bilateral pleural effusion.
- Alveolar bronchial cancer: More or less extensive alveolar opacities, sometimes nodular, containing an aerated bronchogram, in a patient at risk of bronchial cancer.
- Intra-alveolar hemorrhage: Alveolar opacities, the topography of which indicates the site of bleeding.
- Organized pneumonia (cryptogenic or secondary): Alveolar opacities are bilateral and migratory.

**Rubric:** Management  

Neonatal withdrawal syndrome (NNDS) following in utero exposure to opiates affects around 60% of children born to mothers who used opiates or opiate substitution treatments during pregnancy.

The severity and duration of NNDS are not correlated with the dosage of opioid substitution treatment. The severity and duration of the syndrome may be influenced by the concomitant use of other products, particularly benzodiazepines, which can lead to a later and/or longer syndrome. The use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy itself leads to an impregnation and then withdrawal syndrome at birth.

The symptoms are:

- **Neurovegetative:** excitability, hypertonia, hyperreactivity, tremor, startle, high-pitched cry, restless sleep, sweating, hyperthermia
- **Respiratory:** Rhinorrhea (SD-155), sneezing, yawning, respiratory rhythm disorders
- **Digestive:** poor sucking, regurgitation, vomiting, diarrhea

**Notify the NNDS**

**During Pregnancy:**

- Organize an ante-natal pediatric consultation to inform parents.
- Prepare them for the possibility of NNDS and its management: listen to their concerns (guilt, worry), reassure, inform, and stress the essential role of the mother through simple everyday gestures such as breastfeeding and care.

**At Birth:**

- Encourage and support mother-child bonding through breastfeeding, nursing care, rocking, skin-to-skin contact, swaddling, and maintaining a peaceful, quiet atmosphere with soft lighting.
- Detect and assess withdrawal syndrome using the Finnegan score every 4 hours from birth.
- Treat if necessary: if the score exceeds 8 on 3 consecutive assessments, initiate treatment with morphine hydrochloride or sulphate (gradual increase in dosage, maintain dosage for 48 hours until stabilized, then reduce in stages every 48 hours).

**Title:** Understanding the Pathophysiological Mechanism of Mental Confusion

**Rubric:** Pathophysiological Elements

The main clinical symptoms and signs of mental confusion (SD-119) result from attentional disorders (SDD-129), themselves consecutive to impaired vigilance (SDD-028). Attention is the ""gateway"" to cognition; an alteration in attention leads to a major and global disorganization of coherent thought.

The confusional syndrome is determined by risk factors and by a triggering factor (cause of the confusion), which may be neurological or non-neurological. The triggering factor may be minimal (e.g., urinary tract infection) in a subject with risk factors. The main risk factors are:

- Neurosensory disorders: vision abnormality (SD-138); decreased hearing/deafness (SDD-140)
- Chronic psychiatric pathologies: follow-up consultation and basic treatment for a patient suffering from a chronic psychiatric disorder (excluding depression) (SDD-269); follow-up consultation and basic treatment for a depressive patient (SDD-288)
- Consumption of alcohol and psychotropic drugs: prevention of alcohol-related risks (SD-313)

**Description:** Ethics is a philosophical concept that questions and defines right conduct. In medicine, it involves questioning the principles, values, and rules governing the actions of practitioners and researchers to justify them.

**Definition**

=== Meaning and Definition of Ethics, as Distinct from Morality and Deontology ===

Ethics is the ability of individuals to reflect critically on the moral dimension of their actions and practices. It allows people to question the morality of their actions and the relevance of the values, standards, and rules that dictate their behavior. Ethics enables questioning morality, as it is both the source of moral standards and the place where they are questioned. While morality provides answers and restricts freedom, ethics allows us to question choices and arbitrate between contradictory moral obligations. Ethics recognizes moral pluralism but also the need to reach agreement beyond this pluralism through reason and discussion in a democratic context.

Medical practice raises issues due to developments in science and society, such as patients' rights, access to care, genetics, organ removal, and end-of-life decisions. These require reflection to consider the consequences of decisions and to make complex choices in care practices or healthcare organization.

Every decision today involves balancing medical scientific data, individual rights, desires, collective values, norms, and economic constraints. The ethical approach organizes decision-making by considering these elements. Ethics is not a value judgment or a code of good practice linked to legal rules but a process of reflection and analysis to aid decision-making. Morality reflects societal thinking at a given time, while deontology involves rules of good professional practice. Law encompasses rules governing society and is enforced by courts. Ethics and law are intertwined and may evolve over time.

Ethics re-examines moral principles and legal rules, especially when they do not align with people's wishes or when situations cannot be resolved. It involves active, collective reflection on human values and tensions. Ethics studies values, tensions, criteria for choice, and possible scenarios through argument and debate. In medical practice, it guides choices towards decisions concerning the patient.

Ethics involves multidisciplinary reflection, with contributions from human sciences, law, health sciences, and care professionals. It is not a science or subject of positive knowledge, nor does it result from studying facts and behavior. Describing and explaining what is does not define what should be.

=== Ethics of Responsibility and Applied Ethics ===

The ethics of responsibility involves feeling responsible for all consequences of actions, requiring critical analysis of rules or decisions not accepted by all. This approach leads to acting in a singular and reasoned way, favoring a consequentialist approach.

Maximizing knowledge of the consequences of choices and actions is essential. Anticipatory ethics becomes a branch of research with collective analysis, encouraging cooperation among experts from diverse fields and involving debate with affected individuals, patients, and the public. Decisions affecting the future of individuals or everyone should focus on future consequences, sharing information on benefits, doubts, uncertainties, and risks. Practices involving risk or uncertainty, or questioning human values, must be debated.

This approach applies to the medical field, given the upheavals medicine brings to life and society. Promoting a democratic approach to health issues requires linking medical progress with social expectations, especially when practices impact lives and involve debated benefits or risks.

Healthcare ethics is practical and operational, leading to advice guiding action and choices, known as applied ethics. Applied ethics is based on descriptive analyses of cases, surveys of situations, or sociological or ethno-medical studies. It analyzes professional practices and argues the consequences of possible choices. When applied to specific cases, it is 'micro-ethics,' and when concerning societal choices or healthcare policies, it is 'macro-ethics.' Applied ethics aims to guide decision-making.",0.8,13.073333333333338,False,True,0.7812392711639404,0.8156711260477701,b,False,3,4

The National Health Insurance Expenditure Target (ONDAM) represents the forecast amount that must not be exceeded for outpatient and inpatient care, whether provided in private or public establishments or in medical and social centers. It is set each year for health insurance expenditure in France and is used to regulate health insurance expenditure. The ONDAM is determined annually by the Social Security Financing Act (LFSS).

The ONDAM was created by ordinance in 1996 and is set each year by Parliament, in accordance with the provisions of the LFSS. It corresponds to revenue forecasts and social security expenditure targets for:

- Outpatient care
- Public and private health establishments
- Medico-social establishments
- Other care

Within healthcare establishments, sub-targets are set for:

- Public and private establishments charged on an activity basis for their medical, surgical, and obstetric activities (ODMCO: objectif des d√©penses de MCO), and for their missions of general interest and assistance with contractualization (MIGAC)
- Follow-up and rehabilitation care, psychiatry, and long-term care: the ODAM (health insurance expenditure target) and the OQN (national quantified target)

The Comit√© d'alerte sur l'√©volution des d√©penses d'assurance maladie was created by the law of 13 August 2004 on health insurance reform (article 40). It is responsible for alerting Parliament, the Government, and the national health insurance funds in the event of trends in health insurance expenditure that are incompatible with compliance with the national target voted by Parliament.

Each year, by 1 June at the latest, the committee issues an opinion on compliance with the national health insurance expenditure target (ONDAM) for the current financial year. The Alert Committee reports to the Commission des Comptes de la S√©curit√© Sociale. It is made up of the Secretary General of the Commission des Comptes de la S√©curit√© Sociale, the Director General of the Institut national de la statistique et des √©tudes √©conomiques, and a qualified person appointed by the Chairman of the Conseil √©conomique et social.

The health crisis has led to a sharp increase in the 2020 ONDAM. The same is true for 2021 and 2022.

**Note**: The levels of overspending on ONDAM since 2004 have been significant.

**Definitions**  
Compulsory reporting is a major method of epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases, which is mandatory for everyone (doctors, biologists, patients concerned). It enables health authorities to intervene rapidly to protect the health of the population and to have up-to-date information on a health problem deemed important.

In 2021, the Minister for Health defined 36 notifiable diseases (MDO), 34 of which are infectious diseases (most of which are transmissible). This list, available on the website www.santepubliquefrance.fr, may be updated as epidemiology evolves.

**The Three Actors Are:**

- **Declarants:** Biologists and doctors confronted with a suspected or confirmed MDO
- **Medical Inspectors:** From the Agences R√©gionales de Sant√©
- **Epidemiologists:** From Sant√© Publique France

**Compulsory Reporting Process**  
Compulsory reporting is a two-stage process: 

1. **Reporting:** With the exception of Pandemic Influenza outbreaks not requiring urgent public health measures.
2. **Notification:** For all Pandemic Influenza outbreaks.

**Procedure Table**  
The two mandatory reporting procedures for the doctor who cares for the patient and/or the biologist who makes the diagnosis are reporting and notification.

- **Notification:**
  - **Transmission Sequence and Delay:** As a matter of urgency, as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed (or even as soon as the diagnosis is suspected for certain vector-borne diseases at risk of being established in mainland France).
  - **MDO Concerned:** All except HIV, HBV, tetanus
  - **Finality:** Implementation of urgent prevention or control measures around cases (prophylaxis, vaccination...)
  - **Support:** By any appropriate means: telephone, fax, e-mail, etc.
  - **Recipient:** Physician inspector from the ARS responsible for the practice of the practitioner submitting the notification.

**Title:** Identify and Prevent an Error in the Medication Circuit

**Description:** None

Errors may occur at various stages of the medication circuit and may result in the patient being administered:

- The wrong medicine
- The wrong dose
- By the wrong route
- Or the wrong treatment regimen

== Prescription ==
The risks identified as likely to lead to errors are:

- Oral prescription, for example by telephone (normally not authorized except in cases of force majeure), lack of communication between professionals, etc.
- Non-identification or incorrect identification of the patient or prescriber.
- Poorly legible prescriptions, use of abbreviations, incorrect computer prescriptions (example: when it is free text).
- Imprecise or incorrect wording: name, form, strength, dosage, duration, frequency, or route of administration.
- Wrong choice of medicine.
- Contraindications not respected, existence of interactions, associated conditions not taken into account (pregnancy, allergies, past history, etc.).
- Monitoring not specified.

== Preparation ==
The risks identified as likely to lead to errors are:

- Lack of asepsis, risk of cross-contamination, failure to comply with preparation conditions (humidity, light, etc.).
- Errors on the manufacturing sheet, misinterpretation of the preparation procedure, etc.
- Errors in the raw material (lack of qualitative and quantitative identification), undetected physico-chemical incompatibility, errors in the nature or choice of excipients, etc.
- Weighing errors and lack of traceability, calculation errors, errors in the dosage of one or more products, dilution or volume errors, errors in the use or qualification of preparation or control equipment and facilities.
- Packaging errors, labeling errors.

== Transport ==
The risks identified in connection with the transport of medicines are:

- Alteration of packaging, packaging unsuitable for hygiene, etc.
- Non-compliance with storage conditions: light, temperature (respect for the cold chain), pressure, humidity, etc.
- Security of medicines: unidentified and unsealed trolleys or containers.

== Detention and Storage ==
In healthcare establishments, medicines are kept in a place that is not accessible to the public. In community pharmacies, only a restricted list of medicines is available for direct access: ""medicinal products for officinal use"":

- Their packaging is designed to correspond to the dosage and expected duration of treatment.
- This does not apply to drugs with major contraindications, a risk of interactions, or which are intended for pediatric use.

A number of measures are proposed to prevent errors during storage or distribution in dispensing trolleys (in establishments):

- Equipment: secure cupboards, favor unit packaging, harmonize labeling.
- Environment: adequate lighting, guarantee good storage conditions.
- Staff: appoint a person to manage stock in the care unit, take into account the risk of confusion due to similar names and packaging.
- Prefer the full/empty system: the user picks supplies from the first bin. When the first bin is empty, the user signals that it is empty. This signal triggers a command to replenish the bin. At the same time, the user picks supplies from the second bin.

== Dispensation ==
Risks may arise during:

- Analyzing prescriptions (difficult or too quick to read), communicating information.
- Galenic preparation.
- Delivering medicines to care units or directly to patients (storage methods, distractions, work interruptions).

The main errors inherent in this stage are: dose errors, errors of omission, drug errors (similarity of name, presentation, etc.), and galenic form errors.

== Patient Information ==
Informing the patient, who is involved in the care process, is an essential step in avoiding administration errors.

A lack of communication between caregiver and patient can lead to a number of risks of confusion when patients self-administer their medication: dosage (units, drops, etc.), frequency, errors in administration technique, what to do in the event of adverse reactions, etc.

Information campaigns must be tailored to the specific situation of each patient (pathology, level of understanding, culture, lifestyle, etc.). They are carried out in a climate of trust and formulated in an understandable, clear, and precise way. Those providing the information should ensure that it is understood by the patient (rephrasing, leaving time for questions) and those close to the patient, if present.

== Administration ==
The risks identified in connection with the administration of medicines are:

- Errors in dosage, route of administration, form, timing, duration, error in administration technique.
- Omission of administration.
- Administration of out-of-date or degraded medication, unauthorized or unprescribed medication, product selection errors (anesthetic trays, pre-prepared medication, medicine cabinet).
- Failure to record administration, failure to pass on medication NOT TAKEN by the patient to the prescriber and pharmacist.
- Errors in reading or interpreting labeling (frequent).
- Incorrect identification and programming of administration devices.
- Patient errors (e.g., double rooms in hospitals).
- Incorrect preparation of weekly diaries.

To make administration more secure: do away with transcriptions, keep the identifying packaging until the last moment, ask for the patient's identity, inform the patient, etc.

Finally, if you have any doubts about the drug, do not administer it.

== Patient Monitoring ==
To reduce the risk of medication errors, it is particularly important to:

- Know the elements of monitoring by treatment and approach.
- Monitor clinical and biological parameters, and carry out pharmacological therapeutic monitoring where necessary.
- Monitor the occurrence of adverse effects.",0.8333333333333334,10.47529411764706,False,True,0.7639757394790649,0.5303032000859579,d,False,3,3

Risks related to healthcare are regularly assessed, particularly through the national study of adverse events related to healthcare in healthcare establishments (ENEIS). The main results of this ENEIS study are as follows:

- 3 to 5% of medical and surgical admissions were due to a serious adverse event.
- Approximately 50% of serious adverse events leading to hospitalization were associated with healthcare products, half of which were avoidable.
- The observed incidence of serious adverse events during hospitalization in medicine or surgery is around 7%.

- **Two syndromes are absolute emergencies requiring systematic hospitalization**

**Meningitis Syndrome**

- Headache: helmet-shaped, diffuse, intense, resistant to analgesics. Sudden onset, subacute or progressive depending on cause.
- Vomiting: inconstant; effortless, in spurts, and temporarily relieves the headache.
- Photophobia
- Shotgun attitude
- Stiff neck, positive meningeal maneuvers
- Elevated body temperature or normal

Meningitis syndrome with fever suggests infectious meningitis (item 151). Immediate lumbar puncture without prior scan is required.

Meningeal syndrome with normal temperature and sudden onset suggests HSA (item 341). Immediate brain scan is needed, followed by lumbar puncture if the scan is normal.

**Intracranial Hypertension Syndrome**

- Headache: helmet-mounted, diffuse, intense, morning, exaggerated by cough/effort/decubitus, resistant to analgesics. Onset often gradual, sometimes sudden.
- Vomiting: inconstant; effortless, in spurts, and temporarily relieves the headache.
- Disorder of vigilance: obnubilation, confusion, coma.
- Horizontal Diplopia (uni or bilateral VI involvement)
- Visual eclipses: transient, late bilateral loss of vision (due to severe papilloedema)
- Bilateral papilloedema at the fundus
- Infant: fontanel bulge, augmented PC

Space-occupying processes include intracranial tumor (item 299), subdural hematoma, and abscess. Hydrocephalus and cerebral venous thrombosis are also considered. Emergency CT scan or MRI is required. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated before brain imaging but imperative after normal brain imaging or imaging suggesting a meningeal process.

- **Also refer to the emergency department any patient who presents:**

  - A ""brutal"" headache (maximum in less than an hour), or even a thunderclap headache (maximum intensity in less than a minute) suggests SAH until proven otherwise.
  - A headache that is recent or of recent aggravation (< 7 days) and unusual suggests HTIC until proven otherwise.
  - Headache associated with fever (in the absence of an obvious general cause such as a viral syndrome during an epidemic) suggests infectious meningitis.
  - Headache associated with neurological signs (anisocoria, cranial nerves, central neurological deficit).
  - A headache suggestive of CO intoxication.
  - Headache in the context of immunodepression.

- The absence of any associated symptoms and a normal clinical examination do not rule out a secondary headache and should not delay further investigations if the headache is recent, unusual, and persistent.

- Migraine sufferers often present with a severe attack. If the questioning is reliable and the patient recognizes ""his"" usual migraine attack, investigations are not necessary, and treatment will be given to relieve the attack.

- **Red flags in children:**

  - Drop in school results
  - Persistent unilateral localization
  - Epileptic seizures (convulsions)
  - New-onset clumsiness
  - Behavioral problems
  - Change in staturo-ponderal curve

**Rubric:** Definition  

Deep vein thrombosis can lead to post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). There are two main possible mechanisms: valve destruction, which causes reflux, and/or residual venous obstruction. This results in signs of venous insufficiency, which may even lead to venous claudication.

The severity of PTS depends on the extent of venous dysfunction resulting from the sequelae of post-thrombotic syndrome (valvular destruction, residual venous obstruction, and venous reflux). Its severity is assessed using the Villalta score, which is based on subjective and objective clinical signs of venous insufficiency.

**Evaluation of the Severity of Post-Thrombotic Syndrome Using the Villalta Score**

- **Subjective Symptoms (Patient):**
  - Heaviness
  - Pain
  - Cramps
  - Pruritus
  - Paresthesias

- **Objective Signs (Doctor):**
  - Oedema
  - Calf pressure pain
  - Induration of the skin
  - Hyperpigmentation
  - Redness

**Rule of Calculation**

For each symptom or sign, points are awarded:  
0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe

**Interpretation**

- Score ‚â§ 4: No TPS
- Score 5-9: Moderate SPT
- Score 10-14: Intermediate SPT
- Score ‚â• 15 or ulcer present: Severe TPS

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

Abnormalities of the mediastinum in children are generally mass syndromes which may correspond to multiple causes (malformative, vascular, infectious, benign or malignant tumors). The diagnostic approach takes into account the age of the child and the topography of the lesion on the frontal thoracic X-ray, the first-line examination. If there is any doubt on the X-ray, ultrasound is the first test to be carried out in babies and young children. CT scans and MRIs are second-line examinations, mainly for tumor pathology or in older children. The younger the child, the more MRI is preferred to CT for reasons of radiation exposure. In infants, the most common lesions are malformations (bronchogenic cyst, esophageal duplication, etc.), neuroblastomas, and teratomas. In older children (over the age of 7), the most common lesions are hematological malignancies (lymphoma, leukemia).

**Identification of an Abnormal Mediastinal Image**

Reading the frontal radiograph involves locating the abnormality and identifying its topography (anterior, middle, or posterior mediastinum), which involves analyzing the contours and lines of the mediastinum. Mediastinal reflection lines are formed when the X-ray is tangent to the interface between two media of different density. The mediastinal reflection lines include paratracheal lines, posterior mediastinal line, anterior mediastinal line, para-azygo-esophageal line, paravertebral lines, and para-aortic line.

In general, a mediastinal mass present on radiography has:

- Clear external contours
- Internal contours that are not visible (because they are embedded in the normal mediastinal opacity)
- Obtuse connection angles (gently sloping) with the mediastinal opacity

Depending on its topography and size, a mediastinal mass may distort the contours of the mediastinum, repress or obliterate mediastinal lines, or determine certain characteristic signs which facilitate the diagnosis. For example:

- **Silhouette Sign:** A thymic mass in an infant obliterates the left edge of the heart, indicating its anterior location.
- **Lymphoma in a 9-year-old Child:** Enlargement of the upper borders of the mediastinum in relation to a mass syndrome of the anterior mediastinum.
- **Cervico-thoracic Sign:** A right upper mediastinal mass not silhouetted by the right border of the mediastinum, with its external limit remaining visible above the clavicle, confirming its posterior location (neurogenic tumor).
- **Iceberg Sign:** The outer edges of the mass remain visible through the abdominal opacity, indicating a pure intrathoracic location, posterior to the left cupola, as demonstrated by the CT scan.

**Clinical Presentation:**

- The clinical presentation of a hydrocele is that of an enlarged, non-painful, non-inflammatory bursa. In adults, the increase in volume is progressive.
- The testicle is often not perceived because of the volume of fluid surrounding it. The hernial orifices are free.
- Positive transillumination helps in the diagnosis of a hydrocele since the application of a light source behind the scrotum allows light to pass through, unlike an inguinal hernia or a tumour (313).
- In children, the hydrocele is due either to the persistence of the peritoneovaginal canal, known as a communicating hydrocele, or, as in adults, to a reaction to an inflammatory, tumoral, or traumatic phenomenon. In this case, it reflects a failure to resorb the liquid secreted by the vagina (known as a non-communicating hydrocele). The increase in volume is progressive.
- In children, the communicating nature is suggested by the variations in volume during the day, the increase in symptoms when standing, and the possibility of expelling the fluid by squeezing the bursa.
- Sudden tension (often coinciding with a viral infection in children) may be painful, and the skin may be bluish. In this situation, the differential diagnosis of strangulated hernia or torsion of the spermatic cord may be raised.
- In adults, it is common and is due to a defect in the resorption of fluid secreted by the vagina (non-communicating).
- The clinical presentation of a cord cyst is that of a non-painful swelling suspended above and independent of the testicle.

The statistical significance judgment concerns random error (error due to chance, linked to sampling fluctuation phenomena, cf. ""Basic knowledge of sources of error and bias (2C-020-DE-A12)""). The result of a test is said to be significant if the value of p (degree of significance, p-value) is less than a threshold determined a priori (risk of first kind alpha), generally 0.05.

In a statistical test that seeks to demonstrate a difference, the alpha risk is the risk, fixed a priori, of falsely concluding that there is a difference (see ""Statistical tests: principles of hypothesis testing (2C-020-DE-B09)""). The p-value is calculated a posteriori from the observed data and is the probability of observing a difference that is at least as large if, in reality, this difference does not exist. The conclusion of the test is based on the comparison of the value of p with the alpha risk (accepted a priori). If p is greater than alpha, then nothing can be concluded: the probability of observing a difference that is at least as large if, in reality, this difference does not exist is too great compared with the a priori accepted risk of wrongly concluding that there is a difference.

Because of sampling fluctuations, the estimation of a parameter (e.g., a difference in mean, an RR, an OR, an HR, etc.) must always be accompanied by a confidence interval. This is an interval of possible values of the true value of the parameter in the population. Generally, we present the 95% confidence interval (CI<sub>95%</sub>) of a parameter, i.e., the level of confidence associated with the fact that the true parameter of interest belongs to this interval is 95%. In other words, if 100 samples are drawn at random from the same population, the estimate of the parameter will fall within this interval of values for 95 of the 100 samples.",1.0,12.831111111111113,False,True,0.7044142484664917,0.7432844042778015,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Knowing the Indication for Carrying Out a Multi-Allergen IgE Screening Test (Aeroallergens and Trophallergens)

The multi-allergen test is prescribed by the primary care physician. It is recommended for children when there is suspicion of a respiratory or food allergy, and when an allergist is not available for consultation for several months. The test aims to identify IgE sensitization.

**Respiratory Allergy:**
- Tests are similar to those used in adults.

**Food Allergies:**
- Prescriptions vary based on the child's age:
  - **Before the age of 1:** A ""fx5"" test is prescribed, which includes milk, egg, fish, peanut, soya, and wheat. This test can detect over 90% of food allergies.
  - **After 1 year:** A ""Trophatop¬Æ child"" test is prescribed. This test includes the allergens in the fx5 and extends to other allergens such as mustard, hazelnut, shrimp, kiwi, beef, and sesame. It can detect over 90% of allergies before the age of 6 and over 80% after the age of 6. A negative result rules out an allergy to the panel of allergens tested.

**Important Note:** A positive multi-allergen test does not necessarily indicate an allergy. If exposure to the allergen detected as positive is well tolerated, there is no allergy. For example, a positive specific IgE to peanuts, even if the patient consumes peanuts without any issues, indicates sensitization rather than an allergy. It is crucial not to avoid the food in such cases, as doing so may lead to a long-term allergy due to a break in tolerance.",0.6,10.73,False,True,0.855690062046051,0.729808529218038,b,False,4,4

**Definitions**

Several definitions of heart failure co-exist:

- From a pathophysiological point of view, heart failure is defined as an inability of the heart to deliver sufficient flow to meet the body's needs and/or to function with normal filling pressures.

- There is also a universal definition of chronic heart failure (CHF): this is a clinical syndrome with past or present symptoms of CHF (dyspnoea, fatigue) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac anomaly and confirmed by several elements: clinical signs of heart failure (crackles, ankle oedema, jugular turgidity); an elevated level of natriuretic peptide; haemodynamic echocardiographic radiological signs.

Heart failure is classified according to the level of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which corresponds to the proportion of blood ejected with each beat in relation to the ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEF (%) = (end-diastolic volume - telesystolic volume)/end-diastolic volume). Three types of heart failure are classically distinguished:

- Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ‚â§40%) caused by failure of myocardial contraction.

- Systolic heart failure or heart failure with a slightly reduced ejection fraction between 41 and 49%, generally combines the characteristics of the other two types.

- Diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (LVEF ‚â•50%). This is caused by a failure to fill the left ventricle (relaxation compliance).

This definition has therapeutic implications, as most treatment options concern heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ‚â§40%).

The LVEF calculation involves determining the endocardial contours in telediastole on the left and telesystolic on the right.",0.2,10.723333333333333,False,True,0.8188531398773193,0.6519315044085184,c,True,2,4

Impairment of two or three blood lines (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia) on the haemogram requires a myelogram before any specific treatment, as it suggests a bone marrow cause for the cytopenias. Circulating blastosis is not necessary for a myelogram to be indicated.

This will show more than 25% blasts on rich marrow observation in the case of acute leukaemia. This examination should be systematically supplemented by CSF analysis, even in the absence of any neurological symptoms.

## Definitions and Concept of Neuropathic Pain

- Pain caused by injury or disease of the somatosensory system.
- Opposed to ""nociceptive"" pain or ""pain caused by excess nociception"" linked to abnormal activation of the nociceptors (osteoarthritis, arthritis, common lumbago, etc.).
- A distinction is made between peripheral neuropathic pain (nerve trunk, sensory ganglion, plexus, nerve root) and central pain (spinal cord, brain).
- The symptoms and mechanisms of neuropathic pain are only loosely linked to the aetiology. As a result, treatment depends little or not at all on the aetiology, and if possible is based on an analysis of the pain mechanisms.

## Main Etiologies of Neuropathic Pain

- The most common cause of neuropathic pain in the general population is radiculopathy, particularly sciatica (herniated disc, post-spinal surgery, disc disease, etc.).
- Other peripheral causes include:

## Diagnosis and Main Features

- Specific context of onset (e.g., diabetes, shingles, surgery, herniated disc, cerebrovascular accident, etc.), sometimes with a delay (several months or years after the initial event), especially in the case of a central lesion.
- Particular quality of pain: continuous spontaneous pain (such as burning/heat, painful cold, cramps), paroxysmal pain (electric shocks, stabbing), provoked pain (pain induced by friction, cold, heat).
- Presence of paresthesias/dysesthesias in the painful area (paresthesias: abnormal non-painful sensations such as tingling, pins and needles, itching, numbness; dysesthesias: the same, but frankly unpleasant).
- The pain is located in a neuro-anatomical territory compatible with peripheral nerve damage (symmetrical distal distribution beginning in the feet for length-dependent neuropathy, thoracic or trigeminal dermatomal for shingles, radicular for sciatica, etc.) or central (hemi-body for stroke/SEP, both lower limbs for spinal cord damage, etc.).
- Pain is associated with hypoesthesia (hot, cold, stinging), allodynia (pain induced by normally painless stimulation) or hyperalgesia (increased pain in response to painful stimulation) ¬± motor deficit, reflex abnormality, spasticity (depending on the aetiological context).
- Additional tests are not necessary to diagnose the neuropathic nature of the pain. They are useful for confirming the nerve lesion and its aetiology, depending on the clinical context.
- The DN4 questionnaire (neuropathic pain in 4 questions) differentiates DN from nociceptive pain with excellent sensitivity and specificity (> 80%) for a score ‚â• 4 out of 10 and ‚â• 3 out of 7 for its questioning version (without clinical examination) which can be completed by a non-health worker or the patient.

**Title:** Medical Termination of Pregnancy

**Description:** Know the legal provisions governing termination of pregnancy.

**Management**

Know the legislation concerning termination of pregnancy for medical reasons (IMG).

The law states that voluntary termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons can take place without any time limit, i.e., at any time during the pregnancy:

- Either if continuing the pregnancy would seriously endanger the woman's health.
- If there is a strong probability that the unborn child will suffer from a particularly serious condition recognized as incurable at the time of diagnosis.

These two points of the law refer to two very distinct frameworks:

- A situation in which the woman has a medical condition that is incompatible with pregnancy and that jeopardizes her health (e.g., cancer, infection, severe hypertension, psychiatric condition, etc., although the law does not set out these medical conditions or draw up a list, which is impossible to foresee).
- A condition affecting the child, resulting from the monitoring of the pregnancy and prenatal diagnosis, opening the debate on whether or not to continue the pregnancy. The law does not specify what is covered by the terms ""particularly serious condition recognized as incurable"" and does not draw up a list, which again is impossible to predict.

Acceptance of the woman's request is conditional on the opinion (validation) of the request by a multidisciplinary collegiate procedure. In practice, this procedure is carried out within a multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre (CPDPN).

When an abortion is considered on the grounds that continuing the pregnancy would seriously endanger the woman's health, the multidisciplinary team is made up of at least four people:

- A doctor qualified in gynecology-obstetrics, member of a multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre.
- A practitioner specializing in the condition from which the woman suffers.
- A doctor chosen by the woman.
- A qualified person who may be a social worker or psychologist.

The doctor qualified in obstetrics and gynecology and the doctor qualified in the treatment of the woman's condition must work in a health establishment.

The law also specifies that when termination of pregnancy is envisaged on the grounds that there is a strong probability that the unborn child will suffer from a particularly serious condition recognized as incurable at the time of diagnosis, the multidisciplinary team responsible for examining the woman's request is that of a CPDPN. When the team from the aforementioned centre meets, a doctor chosen by the woman may, at her request, be involved in the consultation. Unless it is a medical emergency, the woman is offered a period of reflection of at least one week before deciding whether to terminate or continue her pregnancy.

At the end of the meeting, two doctors who are members of the multidisciplinary team certify that the multidisciplinary opinion has been given and that the request complies with the law. In both cases, prior to the meeting of the competent multidisciplinary team, the woman concerned or the couple is informed and may, at her request, be heard by all or some of the members of the said team.

**Differences between IVG and IMG**

- Termination of pregnancy for medical reasons can only be carried out by a doctor.
- There is no time limit for termination of pregnancy: it can take place at any time during the pregnancy.
- The principles for obtaining the woman's request and consent are the same as for abortion, but the CPDPN is responsible for accepting the request for an abortion, following a rigorous procedure.",0.75,13.063333333333333,False,True,0.8073221445083618,0.619647741317749,b,True,2,2

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

== Occlusion of the Central Retinal Artery (OACR) ==

CRAO results in the following:

- Sudden, very profound drop in visual acuity (light perception)
- Pupil in areflectic mydriasis
- On fundus examination: diffuse narrowing of the arterial calibre, ischaemic white retinal oedema of the retina with cherry-red staining of the macula.
- Clinical picture varies according to the location of the occlusion in the case of occlusion of a branch of the central retinal artery.

The younger the patient, the more exhaustive the aetiological work-up. The causes can be classified into several broad classes according to the mechanism involved:

- Embolisms: carotid atheroma, the most frequent cause, emboligenic heart disease.
- Thrombosis: Horton's disease and systemic diseases, in particular systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's disease, Takayashu disease, Kawasaki disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome.
- Coagulation disorders.

Aetiological assessment and treatment of arterial occlusion must be carried out at the same time, as a matter of urgency, if possible in a neurovascular unit. The search for a curable embolic cause is crucial to avoid the recurrence of emboli in the cerebral territory.

The treatment is similar in many respects to that for ischaemic strokes:

- In all cases, treatment with oral or intravenous aspirin is instituted.
- Only in the case of RCAO in a young patient in good general condition, seen within the first 6 hours, should maximum treatment be considered (Diamox¬Æ, IV vasodilators, fibrinolytics) to achieve rapid repermeabilisation.
- Long-term treatment depends on the aetiological assessment: carotid atheroma (antiplatelet therapy), cardiac emboli whose cause could not be controlled (e.g., atrial fibrillation: antivitamin K), significant carotid stenosis (endarterectomy).

== Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) ==

CRVO is characterised by the following:

- Decrease in visual acuity, which varies greatly depending on the clinical form.
- On fundus examination: papilledema, disseminated retinal haemorrhages, cottony nodules, venous tortuosity and dilatation.
- Clarification of the clinical form of venous occlusion by fundus examination and fluorescein angiography: ischaemic or non-ischaemic form.
- Variable clinical picture depending on the location of the occlusion in the case of occlusion of a branch of the central retinal vein.

In patients aged over 50, the etiological work-up is usually as simple as possible:

- To look for risk factors: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia.
- As well as looking for ocular hypertonia or chronic glaucoma.

In cases of RVCO in patients under 50 years of age or bilateral RVCO, a work-up for a primary coagulation abnormality is necessary (activated protein C resistance, protein C, protein S or antithrombin deficiency).

Non-ischaemic forms in half of cases have a favourable outcome, with normalisation of visual acuity and fundus appearance in 3 to 6 months. In other cases, the outcome is less favourable:

- Either by the transition to an ischaemic form (about a quarter of cases).
- The persistence of cystoid macular oedema (CMO), responsible for a permanent drop in visual acuity.

Ischaemic forms, either immediately or secondarily, have a much more severe prognosis. The AV is immediately collapsed, usually less than 1/20, with no hope of functional recovery due to the major macular ischaemia.

The development of iris neovascularisation is the most serious complication of ischaemic RVC because of the risk of rapid progression to neovascular glaucoma (NVG, 100-day glaucoma).

The aim of treating a CRVO is mainly to prevent or treat complications: macular oedema, by means of intravitreal injections; neovascular complications, by means of laser treatment in order to avoid progression to GNV.

No medical treatment has proved effective in the management of retinal vein occlusions. Non-ischaemic forms may benefit from treatment with isovolaemic haemodilution, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated.

Treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections is indicated in the presence of CMO with reduced visual acuity. In all cases, clinical and angiographic monitoring every month from the outset will enable early detection of the transition to an ischaemic form. For ischaemic forms, laser retinal panphotocoagulation (RPP) should be performed immediately when the ischaemia is very extensive, without waiting for the appearance of iris neovascularisation. If a GNV has already developed, PPR should be performed as a matter of urgency, after lowering ocular tone with local hypotonising treatment and acetazolamide (Diamox¬Æ) per os or intravenously. In the most serious cases, surgery may be required in order to hypotonise the eye.",0.5714285714285714,9.92666666666667,False,True,0.7817692756652832,0.6135127941767374,c,False,4,3

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Identification of the Emergency  

== Anatomical Reminder ==

=== The Oculomotor Nerve (III) Has Two Types of Fibres: ===

- Somatic efferent (motor) fibres, intended for:
  - The following oculomotor muscles: medial rectus, inferior rectus, superior rectus, and inferior oblique
  - The upper eyelid lift muscle
- Visceral efferent fibres (parasympathetic) to:
  - The pupillary sphincter muscle, responsible for pupillary constriction or myosis
  - The ciliary muscle, responsible for accommodation
  - These pre-ganglionic parasympathetic fibres relay at the level of the ciliary ganglion with post-ganglionic fibres which reach their targets

=== Trajectory of the Oculomotor Nerve (III) ===

- The oculomotor nerve originates in the periaqueductal region of the midbrain and then emerges in the interpeduncular fossa.
- It then travels successively:
  - Into the arachnoid and subarachnoid spaces, where it is connected to the posterior communicating artery
  - The roof and then the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus
  - The superior orbital fissure
  - The orbit

== Symptoms Associated with Damage to the Oculomotor Nerve (III) ==

It is secondary to a lesion of the two contingents of fibres, which may be associated or dissociated:

- Damage to somatic fibres (""extrinsic III"") induces:
  - A defect in palpebral opening (ptosis)
  - Paralysis of the muscles innervated by III:
    - The patient reports binocular diplopia (double vision) and on examination there is strabismus (eyes not in focus)
    - The characteristics of the diplopia and strabismus depend on which muscles are paralysed
- Lesion of the parasympathetic fibres (""intrinsic III"") induces:
  - Pupillary dilation (miosis)
  - An accommodation defect

In a comatose patient, the observation of mydriasis should raise the suspicion of temporal involvement and require emergency treatment.

In a conscious patient, the onset of acute ptosis should prompt a search for associated signs of III lesion (diplopia, strabismus, mydriasis, accommodation disorders). It should raise the possibility of an intracranial retrocarotid aneurysm (originating in the posterior communicating artery) which may compress the III in its subarachnoid course. This aetiology is all the more likely to be evoked if there are headaches suggestive of subarachnoid (or meningeal) haemorrhage.

== Differential Diagnosis ==

Claude Bernard-Horner syndrome is secondary to damage to the sympathetic system along its entire course:

- Cerebral trunk, especially Wallenberg syndrome

**Title:** Main Pathophysiological Mechanisms Responsible for CVI  
**Description:** Principles of Venous Return Physiology and Dysfunctions Leading to Varicose Veins and CVI  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology

Arterial circulation is driven by the contraction of the heart's ventricles, propelling blood into the arteries. Venous return is facilitated by a combination of suction and propulsion forces, aided by centripetal and unidirectional venous valves that act as anti-reflux devices. The cooperation of these mechanisms means that any malfunction can lead to venous return anomalies, clinically expressed as chronic venous insufficiency and the dilation of superficial veins, known as varicose veins.

== Deep Venous Network, Superficial Venous Network ==  
There are two venous networks in the lower limbs:

- The deep venous network: Drains 90% of venous blood.
- The superficial venous network (primarily the greater saphenous vein and lesser saphenous vein): Handles the remaining 10% of venous blood.
- These networks, separated by the superficial muscular aponeuroses, are connected by perforating veins.

These data are categorized in the CEAP classification (""A"" for anatomy):

- **S**: Superficial
- **D**: Deep
- **P**: Perforating

== Venous Reflux or Venous Obstruction ==  
Venous insufficiency is linked to either venous reflux or venous obstruction, often following deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. These mechanisms may occur in isolation or conjunction. The pathophysiological mechanisms (""P"" for pathophysiology) are included in the CEAP classification:

- **R**: Reflux
- **O**: Obstruction

== Venous Return ==  
Venous return from the lower limbs occurs against orthostatic pressure due to gravity. The factors influencing venous return include:

- Left ventricular perfusion pressure (residual capillary pressure is higher than diastolic pressure)
- Atrial depression and diaphragmatic movements, which draw venous blood into the right atrium
- The veno-muscular pump of the lower limbs

**Definitions**

In France, under the bioethics laws, genetic testing is primarily conducted for medical or scientific research purposes. This aligns with clinical objectives and includes genetic fingerprinting for identification purposes.

**Special Case: Identification by Genetic Fingerprinting**

Genetic fingerprinting is used in forensic medicine to identify deceased individuals or for paternity searches. Identification is legally restricted to three contexts:

1. **Legal Proceedings**: Identification can be sought during investigations or to establish the identity of unknown deceased persons. It requires a magistrate's instruction and must be conducted in approved laboratories by registered experts. Written consent from the individual is mandatory, and posthumous identification is prohibited without prior consent.

   Facilities storing biological samples must ensure:
   - Protection against theft or damage
   - Absolute confidentiality
   - Protection of samples and results

2. **Paternity Tests**: Conducted during legal proceedings to establish or contest parentage, requiring the presumed father's consent. Tests are ordered by a judge and involve blood sample comparison and genetic fingerprinting.

3. **National Defence Code**: Used to identify deceased military personnel or those posing a security threat. Samples may be taken from frequented places or relatives, with written consent required.

**Common Case: Genetic Characteristics Examination in Healthcare or Research**

For medical or research purposes, written consent is required before genetic testing, with the option to revoke consent at any time. The analysis aims to:

- Diagnose genetic diseases
- Identify gene characteristics linked to diseases
- Adapt medical treatment based on genetic traits

Examinations follow good practice rules defined by the Health Minister, including:

- Initial written consent after full information
- Option to refuse test results
- Obligation to inform family of serious genetic anomalies, with the option for the doctor to inform them anonymously

**Ethical Issues in Predictive Genetics**

**Prediction Impact**

Predictive testing can significantly affect life and liberty. It offers benefits like early monitoring for certain cancers but may have no medical benefit for untreatable diseases. Benefits include:

- Individual autonomy and decision-making
- Social and family planning

Ethical questions arise about:

- Individual autonomy and freedom
- Risk of discrimination and misuse of information

Laws ensure respect for human rights, requiring explicit consent, medical use limitation, and confidentiality.

**Collective Dimension of Genetic Data**

Genetic information affects not just the individual but also family members. Silence on genetic risks can be seen as a loss of opportunity. Ethical dilemmas arise between individual rights and collective responsibility.

Doctors must inform patients of the risks of silence for family members. Patients can authorize doctors to inform family members anonymously about potential genetic risks, following guidelines from the French National Consultative Ethics Committee.

**Key Points**

- Genetic fingerprinting is restricted to legal proceedings, research, and identifying unknown deceased persons.
- Posthumous identification requires prior consent.
- Doctors must inform patients of the risks of silence for family members in genetic disease cases, with arrangements for informing them documented.",0.875,12.935789473684213,False,True,0.872785210609436,0.5009699960549673,b,False,5,4

**Title:** Knowing the pathophysiology of antierythrocyte alloimmunisation  
**Description:** Understand and explain foetomaternal alloimmunisation  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**  
Anti-erythrocyte alloimmunisation corresponds to the presence in a pregnant woman of an irregular antibody, i.e., non-A, non-B, directed against a blood group antigen. There are risks for the foetus and/or newborn baby if it has the corresponding antigen. This is the leading cause of foetal anaemia.

The patient may become immune during pregnancy as a result of foetomaternal haemorrhage (passage of ""incompatible"" foetal red blood cells into the maternal circulation).

The most frequent and serious alloimmunisations with foetal and neonatal consequences are anti-D (Rh1), c (Rh4), or Kell. Other blood group antigens may be involved much more rarely and with a lower risk (anti-E).

This situation can lead to foetal anaemia in cases of foetal-maternal blood incompatibility. If the foetus has the erythrocyte antigen corresponding to the maternal antibody, the passage of maternal antibodies across the placenta may be responsible for haemolysis and therefore foetal anaemia. In the case of severe anaemia, this can lead to hydrops (effusion of foetal serosa) and foetal death.

- Above all, ensure the diagnosis is certain, and do not hesitate to refer to a center if in doubt.
- Long-term antibiotic treatment should be the exception rather than the rule and is only necessary in very specific cases. The introduction of such treatment should prompt the patient to seek advice from a referral center.
- Treatment is largely guided by questioning, which often enables identification of risk factors specific to each patient.

== Hygienic and Dietary Measures ==

- Only increasing oral hydration has been formally proven to be effective.
- Post-coital micturition and not retaining micturition seem beneficial; however, it is primarily the ""micturition catalogue"" that will provide information on the ""errors"" made by the patient.
- Regularization of transit, wearing cotton underwear, and wiping from front to back are measures that have not yet been proven effective in the scientific literature.

- First cystitis under the age of 15 (OR = 3.9)
- New partner (OR = 1.9)
- Spermicide (OR = 1.8); the only truly modifiable factor

== Non-Antibiotic Treatments Shown to be Effective ==

- Cranberry, but with a low level of evidence. Only oral supplements with a minimum dose of 36 mg/day of type A proanthocyanidin appear to be effective (no benefit from cranberry juice or derivatives).
- Immunoactive prophylaxis (vaccine, not available in France) has been shown to be effective in studies with a high level of evidence.
- Local estrogen therapy has also been shown to be effective, particularly in post-menopausal women.

== Long-Term Antibiotic Prophylaxis ==

If these measures fail and there is more than one episode per month, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis may be offered as follows:

- Continuous trimethoprim
- Fosfomycin-tetamol, one sachet per week
- Taken only in the pericoital period when sexual intercourse is the triggering factor (without exceeding the usual doses; not taken with each act of intercourse if there is frequent sexual activity).

- Nociceptive pain, or pain caused by an excess of nociception, serves as a useful alarm signal in the acute phase. It provides information about a stimulus‚Äîinjury or aggression‚Äîthat threatens tissue integrity.

- These pains are generally acute and sometimes associated with neuropathic phenomena, referred to as mixed pain (e.g., cancer pain).

- They are frequent and still too often outsourced.

- Treatment focuses not only on the intensity but also on the etiology.

**Main Etiologies of Nociceptive Pain**

- Traumatic and/or intra- and post-operative pain: This is not directly correlated with the extent of tissue damage and varies from one individual to another. Intra-operative pain is prevented by anesthesia (general or loco-regional), while post-operative pain requires an analgesic strategy.

- Inflammatory pain is often acute, as in renal colic (due to distension and inflammatory reaction of the urinary tract upstream of an obstacle) or tissue infection, or more prolonged, as in arthritis flare-ups in the context of chronic joint damage (rheumatoid arthritis, chondrocalcinosis, gout).

- Mechanical pain, linked to movement, occurs either when walking in a context of osteoarthritis, spinal joint overload (cervicalgia, dorsalgia, lumbago), during prolonged joint stress, or during certain treatments, particularly physiotherapy.

- Pain of cancer.

- Pain induced by treatment.

**Diagnosis and Main Features**

- Unlike neuropathic pain, nociceptive pain does not necessarily have a specific symptomatology.

- They are generally located opposite the lesion and may be associated with inflammatory signs, particularly in the event of acute pain or acute painful flare-ups of a chronic pathology (e.g., osteoarthritis flare-ups).",0.625,15.638095238095236,False,True,0.7960541248321533,0.6279191772143046,c,False,5,3

**From a clinical point of view on examination**

- The ADAM (androgen deficiency in aging male) Score should be used to assess symptoms as part of the diagnosis of TDS.

- TDS leads to:
  - Sexuality disorders: Erectile dysfunction (126), lower libido, quality of orgasms (58)
  - Neuropsychological disorders: loss of memory and attention, mood disorders, irritability, sleep disorders.
  - Vasomotor disorders: hypersudation, hot flushes, etc.

The Higham score is used to assess menorrhagia severity.

**From a clinical point of view on physical examination**

- Look for:
  - Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and increased visceral fat.
  - Decreased hair growth with skin atrophy and the appearance of painless gynaecomastia.
  - Signs in favor of sarcopenia: muscle wasting, reduced muscle strength.
  - Signs of reduced bone mineral density: recent fracture, loss of height, etc.

**Description:** None  

**Vaccination in Immunocompromised Patients**

Vaccination in the case of immunodepression has certain specific features which justify specific recommendations:

- The risk of developing vaccine disease after administration of a live vaccine contraindicates the use of these vaccines in immunocompromised patients.
- The reduced immunogenicity of vaccines may, in some cases, justify special vaccination regimens.
- An increased risk of complications associated with certain infections justifies the recommendation of specific vaccinations.
- When immunosuppressive treatment can be planned, patients should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before the start of the treatment.
- In certain situations, protective serum antibodies may be measured four to six weeks after vaccination (or at a later date) to check the immunogenicity of the vaccination and suggest additional injections if the response is insufficient.

**Counterindications**

- The existence of an immune deficiency is a contraindication to vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine (MMR, BCG, oral polio vaccine, yellow fever, VZV).

**Indications**

- In immunocompromised patients, ensure that the vaccination schedule is up to date.
- Immunocompromised patients should receive an influenza vaccination every year.
- Certain specific vaccines will be used depending on the immunodeficiency concerned.

**Description:** Knowing How to Define, Recognize, and Interpret

The existence of a statistically significant association does not determine the causal nature of the relationship between an exposure and a health phenomenon. While experimental studies can provide proof of causality, observational studies can only discuss the plausibility of this causality in light of the Bradford Hill causality criteria:

**Bradford Hill Causality Criteria**

- **Criteria Internal to the Study:**
  - Statistical association between exposure and the phenomenon studied
  - Strength of the association
  - Dose-effect relationship
  - Specificity of the relationship
  - Minimization of selection and ranking bias. All known confounding factors are correctly taken into account.
  - Absence of temporal ambiguity (exposure must precede the phenomenon studied)

- **Criteria External to the Study:**
  - External consistency: consistency between study results
  - Biological plausibility (known pathophysiological mechanism)
  - Consistency with in vitro and animal studies
  - Parallel geographical gradients in exposure and the phenomenon studied
  - Decrease in the incidence of the phenomenon studied when exposure is eliminated or reduced

*Note: The criterion of specificity of the relationship between exposure and the phenomenon studied is very convincing when present but is often absent even if the causal relationship is plausible. It is now accepted that an effect can be multi-causal (environment, genetic, etc.), and therefore the specificity of the relationship is no longer an essential causality criterion.*

**A. General Mechanisms of Edema Formation**

1. Alteration of capillary hemodynamics linked to:
   - Increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure (Starling force)
   - Decrease in plasma oncotic pressure
   - Increase in capillary permeability

2. Mechanisms of sodium and water retention:
   - The amount of sodium, not its concentration, determines the extracellular volume. The body's sodium balance is regulated by the kidneys.
   - Two main types of phenomena may be responsible for edema formation:
     - True hypervolemia: primary sodium retention by the kidney during renal failure
     - Relative or ""effective"" hypovolemia: right or global cardiac insufficiency, edema-ascitic decompensation of cirrhosis, hypoalbuminemia, particularly in nephrotic syndrome

**B. Specific Mechanisms of Edema Formation**

1. Renal Insufficiency:
   - During acute or severe chronic renal failure, the sodium balance becomes positive.

2. Nephrotic Syndrome and Glomerular Nephropathy:
   - In the filling deficit theory, the fall in oncotic pressure causes hypovolemia and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
   - In the overfilling theory, a primary excess of distal sodium reabsorption is responsible for the positive sodium balance.

3. Heart Failure:
   - Effective hypovolemia secondary to the reduction in cardiac output, and therefore renal blood flow, stimulates the antinatriuretic systems (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, etc.) responsible for sodium and water reabsorption.

4. Cirrhosis of the Liver:
   - Effective hypovolemia results from sequestration of blood in the splanchnic territory upstream of the liver and a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and systemic arterial pressure, leading to activation of the water and sodium reabsorption systems.",0.8888888888888888,15.220000000000002,False,True,0.7931265234947205,0.6679862340291342,b,False,2,2

**Rubric:** Diagnosis

**Definitions:**

Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is the main complication of chronic and heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Its incidence in France is around 1 to 2 per 1000 in its complete form, and it is often under-diagnosed. This syndrome combines four elements, to varying degrees:

- Moderate intrauterine growth retardation
- Typical facial dysmorphia including:
  - Abnormalities of the upper lip (thinness) and philtrum (bulging)
  - Pronounced nasal bridge, short nose
  - Narrow palpebral fissures, epicanthus, and hypertelorism
  - Bilateral ptosis
  - Hypertrichosis with synophrisis
  - Cleared chin with retrognathism
  - Low and poorly hemmed ears
- Malformations: present in 10 to 30% of severe forms, mainly neurological (spina bifida, agenesis of corpus callosum, cerebellar anomalies, hydrocephalus, etc.), cardiac (mainly CIA and CIV), skeletal (scoliosis, radio-ulnar synostosis, clinodactyly, etc.), and facial (cleft lip and palate).
- Delayed acquisition, combining cognitive and behavioral problems of varying intensity. In the most severe forms, the delay in acquisition may be referred to as mental retardation and prevent the child from having a conventional education or even being independent (living in an institution). These disorders may appear even though there is no growth retardation or dysmorphia, particularly in cases where alcohol consumption is more moderate. In these cases, we prefer to use the term FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder) rather than FAS, which can occur at a rate of up to 5 per 1000 births. There may also be an isolated drop in intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioral problems such as aggression, hyperactivity, fine motor skills or tone disorders, and delayed acquisition of language and writing.

Preimplantation diagnosis (PGD) involves analyzing the genetic heritage of a three-day-old embryo obtained via in vitro fertilization before its transfer to the uterus. This process aims to prevent the transmission of genetic diseases present in the parents. PGD is a form of medically assisted procreation that allows couples at high risk of transmitting genetic diseases to avoid prenatal diagnosis and potential pregnancy termination. Only embryos free of the familial genetic disease are transferred. In France, PGD is highly regulated and authorized only in exceptional cases where there is a high probability of a child being born with a serious, incurable genetic disease at the time of diagnosis.

**Ethical Issues**

The ethical debate around PGD primarily concerns its potential developments. Initially intended for prenatal diagnosis, PGD applications have expanded significantly. The most controversial practices include:

- **HLA Typing of Embryos:** This is used for hematological disorders, allowing the selection of embryos immunologically compatible with a sick sibling requiring a marrow transplant. This practice raises concerns about the instrumentalization of procreation, often referred to as the ""medicine baby"" or ""donor baby"" concept. In France, HLA typing is permitted for hereditary diseases but prohibited otherwise. The CCNE emphasizes that the primary justification for PGD is the birth of a child free from serious genetic disorders, with immunological compatibility being secondary. However, in some countries, the lack of regulations allows these practices, leading to medical nomadism.

- **Sex Selection for Convenience:** This practice involves selecting the sex of an embryo for personal preference, known as 'social sexing.' The ethical debate contrasts the freedom to choose a child's sex with the principle of gender equality. Proponents argue that it aligns with autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice, without societal risks or eugenics, and helps balance family gender ratios. Opponents highlight potential harm to the child and risks of eugenics and gender standardization.

**Therapeutic Management Overview**

Therapy is patient-centered. The most important stage in managing the disease is therapeutic education. The first step is to make the diagnosis, as identifying the symptoms is crucial for justifying and organizing treatment. Often, normal clinical and paraclinical test results are not enough to reassure the patient. It is essential to explain the benign nature of the disease and the chronicity of the symptoms. Time must be taken to explain the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, such as alteration of the intestine-brain axis, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal motor disorders, and intestinal dysbiosis, along with the various treatment options. The aim of this approach is to avoid medical nomadism. The doctor-patient relationship is fundamental. To achieve this, the doctor must listen to the patient's expectations and questions, and avoid inaccurate and vexatious statements such as ""There's nothing wrong with you"" or ""It's all in your head.""

When a doctor prescribes treatment, it is important to set reasonable targets for the patient. The efficacy of treatments is often uncertain and does not lead to a cure. The aim is to improve symptoms to enhance quality of life. It is important to plan the assessment of treatment efficacy to ensure no warning signs are missed that may warrant a colonoscopy.

**Medicinal Treatments**

Medicinal treatments are based on the prescription of antispasmodics and transit regulators initially. In the second line, treatments such as certain diets, probiotics, or hypnosis may also be used. Psychological treatment, or even antidepressants, may also be utilized. It should be explained that the target is not a mood disorder, but digestive symptoms, particularly abdominal pain.

**Dietary Management**

As far as dietary management is concerned, simple dietary hygiene advice is offered as a first line of defense (e.g., three meals a day, eat slowly, avoid excessively fatty foods). When these measures are already respected or are insufficient, patients can be offered a diet low in Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides And Polyols (FODMAPs) over a period of 4 to 8 weeks. This diet eliminates malabsorbed carbohydrates and often results in improved digestive comfort. It is useful for this diet to be supervised by a dietician.

== Initiation of Treatment ==  
The drug is chosen based on its marketing authorization for the disorder in question and its safety profile. If an anxiety disorder and a depressive episode coexist, an antidepressant with marketing authorization for the anxiety disorder may be chosen.

In the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, the dosage used is higher (often double the dose) than in the treatment of depressive episodes.

In elderly patients, the initial dose should be half that used in adults, with doses gradually increased. For anxious patients, start at half dose for a few days.

In practice, in outpatient treatment, except in special cases, it is recommended that an SRI, SNRI, or possibly an antidepressant from the ""other antidepressants"" class should be prescribed as first-line treatment because they are better tolerated. An imipraminic should be prescribed as a third-line treatment.

The balance between potential benefit and risk should consider the small effect size of antidepressants, particularly in children and adolescents (where only fluoxetine appears to have demonstrated efficacy).

The patient is informed of:

- Time to efficacy (approximately 3 weeks)
- Duration of treatment (at least 6 months after achieving remission, longer in the case of recurrent depressive disorder or in elderly patients)
- The possibility of withdrawal symptoms when treatment is stopped

== Pre-Therapy Assessment ==  

- SSRIs and SRIs: No paraclinical work-up required.
- Imipraminics/IMAO: ECG, ophthalmology, renal and liver tests, EEG if history of epilepsy. An ophthalmological assessment is required if angle-closure glaucoma is suspected.

**Rubric:** Definition  

The body is a multidimensional object of study. This is why the humanities and social sciences have explored the human body in various ways. Whether approached through history, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, or literature, the body offers an abundance of possible approaches to its study.

Representations of what a healthy body looks like change over time.

The choice of foods suited to human beings, the way we eat, physical exercise, gender assignment, the regulation of procreation, and aesthetic standards are all social constructions that adapt to cultural traditions and the natural environment. Eating helps reconstruct social logics and group identities. Dietary prohibitions in several religious traditions, health regimes linked to different life stages, particularly childhood and old age ('ageing well'), the impact of certain foods on the emotional and affective sphere, and the importance of gastronomy in social interactions place human food at the heart of a social, symbolic, and economic system with implications for representations of the body in a given place and time. For example, overweight, which in the Renaissance was synonymous with good health, gradually became a major public health problem from the 1960s-1970s onwards. This change began in the 16th century with the evolution of beauty codes, illustrated by clothing habits such as corseting. There are close links between aesthetics, the standards imposed by fashion, and body standards. This is also linked to the industrialization and urbanization of society, imposing a more sedentary lifestyle and leading to new consumer habits and a richer diet.

For sociologists, notably Pierre Bourdieu, the body performs at least three functions: memory, learning class habits, and as a marker of social position. The body bears witness to inequalities between social classes, depending on eating habits or the type of work performed, which do not shape bodies in the same way.

In addition to social differences, there are cultural differences. Voluntary transformations of the body, such as tattoos, piercings, and scarification, have different functions in different eras and societies. There are also differences in the production of bodily norms and rules depending on religion.

Addressing the question of the body is intrinsically linked to the question of identity, particularly the construction of sexual identity. Becoming a man or a woman is considered from the angle of the construction of social gender and not just biological differentiation.",1.0,13.718888888888891,False,True,0.7153201699256897,0.8316907286643982,c,True,2,3

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**  
The onset of puberty is hypothalamic, characterized by the reactivation of GnRH pulsatility (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone). GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone). This pulsatility is modulated by neuroendocrine and peripheral factors, including leptin produced by adipose tissue, genetic and ethnic factors, nutritional status, and intercurrent pathologies.

**Puberty in Boys**  
- FSH is responsible for the growth of testicular volume.  
- LH stimulates the production of testosterone, leading to the development of secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., penis, hair) and musculoskeletal changes.

**Puberty in Girls**  
- LH and FSH lead to ovarian activation and the production of oestrogens.  
- Oestrogens cause the development of mammary, uterovaginal, and external genital structures, followed by the onset of the first menstrual periods (menarche).

**Additional Factors**  
- Pubic hair development is linked to the production of gonadal and adrenal androgens.  
- The increase in sex hormones enhances the frequency and amplitude of growth hormone (GH) secretion peaks, accelerating the speed of statural growth (pubertal growth peak).",1.0,11.784285714285716,False,True,0.7986874580383301,0.5985061128934225,c,False,4,3

**Balance of Benefits and Risks of HRT in Natural Menopause**

**Benefits:**

- **Climacteric Syndrome:** The most effective treatment for the functional signs of menopause.
- **Fracture Risk:** First-line treatment to prevent postmenopausal bone loss.
- **Cardiovascular Impact:** Decreased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) if HRT is started within 10 years of menopause. Risk of stroke and neutral venous thromboembolism (VTE) with cutaneous route plus progesterone or dydrogesterone.

**Risks:**

- Increased risk of MI if HRT is started more than 10 years after menopause.
- **Carcinological Risk:** Decreased risk of colorectal cancer and overall mortality. Increased risk of breast cancer (no excess risk in European observational studies for a duration of 5-7 years). Increased risk of endometrial cancer (mitigated by taking a progestin at least 12 days a month). Increased risk of ovarian cancer (RR=1.14 [1.10-1.19]).

Overall, the benefit/risk balance of HRT is still considered positive in women who are symptomatic and/or at risk of osteoporosis in the first 10 years of menopause or before the age of 60.

== Balance of Benefits and Risks of HRT for Premature Ovarian Failure (POI) ==

In the case of POI, the term ""hormone replacement therapy"" (HRT) is used. In the absence of HRT in women with POI, there is an increase in:

- Cardiovascular mortality
- Osteoporosis
- Cognitive degeneration

Continuation of HRT is recommended until the theoretical age of physiological menopause (no increased risk of breast cancer compared with a woman who is still regulated).

Overall, the benefit/risk balance of HRT is always positive in cases of POI, cancelling out the cardiovascular and bone risks induced by early estrogen deficiency.

== Alternatives to HRT ==

Non-hormonal alternatives for the treatment of flushing are less effective than HRT. Several alternatives are available:

=== Pharmacological Alternatives ===

Certain treatments with a main effect and a marketing authorization (MA) that is not the management of the functional signs of menopause have a demonstrated positive effect on the frequency and severity of BVMs:

- Serotonin reuptake inhibitors
- Clonidine
- Gabapentin

=== Food Supplements, Phytoestrogens, Pollen Extracts, Phytotherapy ===

In general, no proven efficacy compared to placebo. Be careful with phytoestrogens, which are contraindicated if you have a history of breast cancer.

=== Non-Pharmacological Alternatives ===

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis

**Definitions:**

The diagnosis of occupational asthma is based on:

1. **Demonstration of Asthma:** Positive diagnosis in a patient with or without a history of allergy (adult de novo asthma). It may be necessary to carry out a non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness test (metacholine) in the case of more atypical symptoms (nocturnal cough, chest tightness, etc.) and normal basal EFR. This asthma usually occurs in the first few years of exposure, and may follow allergic rhinitis, but can also occur at a later date, when a product or manufacturing process is changed, or when exposure is more extensive.

2. **Evidence of Occupational Exposure:** Exposure to a sensitizing agent, which may be easy to find (e.g., wheat or rye flour in a bakery, persulphates in a hairdresser's), or may require in-depth research with the occupational physician (chemical substances such as isocyanates, acid anhydrides, etc.).

3. **Link Between Asthma and Occupational Exposure:** This may be clinical (occupational rhythmicity of symptoms disappearing during weekends or holidays), functional (variations in peak flow or FEV1 depending on exposure), or even require a bronchoprovocation test in hospital.

Asthma associated with heavy or repeated exposure to non-sensitizing respiratory irritants, such as chlorine gas, phosgene, etc. (bronchial irritation syndrome), can also be encountered.

In complete forms (called classic forms: no enzyme activity), the clinical diagnosis in little girls is an abnormality of the external genitalia, ranging from clitoral hypertrophy to a male appearance without testicles. The boy's genitals are normal.

In both boys and girls, hypoglycemia can cause hypotonia or even convulsions, persistent cholestatic jaundice, and arterial hypotension. Mineralocorticoid deficiency leads to poor weight gain, failure to regain birth weight, difficulty suckling, vomiting, dehydration, and even cardiovascular collapse. ""Dehydration in children (SD-032)"" and ""Icterus in newborns (SD-048)""

Neonatal screening for classic forms has been systematic in France since 1995, involving the measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone on blotting paper on the third day of life. ""Systematic newborn screening (SD-308)""

**Renal Infarction:**

- The presentation is severe and may include:
  - Back pain mimicking renal colic or abdominal pain
  - Macroscopic haematuria
  - Hypertensive flare-up
  - Anuria if the occlusion is bilateral or in a single kidney
  - Fever
- Biological indicators:
  - Elevation of LDH
  - Variable elevation of creatinine
  - Inflammatory syndrome
- Diagnosis is confirmed by spiral CT scan, MRI angiography, or arteriography.
- This is an emergency because revascularization (by intraluminal angioplasty or surgery) can only be performed in the first few hours following occlusion. Therapeutic alternatives include fibrinolytics and anticoagulants.

**Benign Nephroangiosclerosis:**

- Often a diagnosis of exclusion, based on several factors:
  - Background: cardiovascular history, cardiovascular risk factors, elderly subject
  - Long-standing hypertension, often poorly controlled, with repercussions (left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertensive retinopathy)
  - Slowly progressive chronic renal failure
  - Poor urinary syndrome:
    - No haematuria or leucocyturia
    - Proteinuria absent or moderate
  - Kidneys of normal or reduced size depending on the degree of renal failure, symmetrical in size, with harmonious contours and no renal artery stenosis

**Cholesterol Embolism Diseases:**

- Diagnosis is based on the combination of an atheromatous background, a triggering factor, and the clinical picture.

**Presentation of Cholesterol Crystal Emboli:**

- **Triggering Factors:**
  - Aortic surgery
  - Arteriography (performed a few days to several weeks before the first signs appear)
  - Anticoagulant or thrombolytic treatment

- **Clinical Signs:**
  - Often a few days or weeks after the triggering factor (latency period)
  - Acute renal failure
  - Purple toes, livedo, distal gangrene
  - Asthenia, myalgias
  - Signs of mesenteric ischaemia
  - Neurological signs: stroke, transient ischemic attack, confusional syndrome
  - Vision problems

- **Biological Signs:**
  - Inflammatory syndrome
  - Eosinophilia, hypocomplementemia (these last two signs are inconstant)

The diagnosis must be confirmed by one of the following tests to identify the crystals:

- Fundus examination
- Skin biopsy of a livedo (risk of non-healing)
- Renal biopsy: shows occlusion of small-calibre arterioles by cholesterol crystal emboli, with a significant inflammatory reaction nearby

== Administrative Organization ==

The administrative organization of organ transplantation activities is based on the Agence de la Biom√©decine (Biomedicine Agency), which has the following missions:

- Managing the national list of patients awaiting transplantation.
- Coordinating organ harvesting and the distribution and allocation of harvested organs.
- Evaluating the medical activities of transplantation teams.
- Managing the National Refusal Register (RNR).
- Promoting transplantation research.
- Promoting organ donation.

The award rules depend on:

- Medical criteria (e.g., ABO blood group, HLA compatibility, shortest possible cold ischemia time).
- Equity criteria (e.g., waiting time).
- Priority criteria that depend on the urgency of the transplant and the difficulty of finding a compatible recipient.",1.0,13.080000000000002,False,True,0.7572528123855591,0.6076343854268392,c,False,4,4

**Title:** Know How to Carry Out a Foetal Karyotype

**Description:** How a Foetal Karyotype is Performed

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

The foetal karyotype is performed on a sample of:

- Chorionic villus (CVS) between 12 and 14 weeks of amenorrhoea
- Amniotic fluid (PLA) between 15 weeks of amenorrhoea and the end of pregnancy
- Exceptionally on foetal blood after 24 weeks of amenorrhoea

The risks are:

- Risk of foeto-placental discordance (1-2%) for CVS
- Risk of crop failure
- Risk of infection following sampling
- Risk of miscarriage estimated at 0.5% following CVS and 0.2% following PLA
- Risk of foetomaternal Rh(D) alloimmunisation in Rh(D) women; prophylaxis by injection of anti-D immunoglobulins should be considered
- Risk of bradycardia following puncture of foetal blood

Time taken to obtain results:

- The CVS allows a response within 2-3 days on direct examination, and 2-3 weeks for the definitive culture result.
- Karyotype results from amniocentesis take 2 to 3 weeks. A faster technique (24-48 hours) using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) with a probe specific for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y on interphase nuclei can be used to obtain rapid results in the event of an ultrasound anomaly suggestive of foetal aneuploidy.

**Title:** Knowing the target values for the international normalized ratio (INR) in relation to valve prostheses and the terrain  
**Description:** None  

Mechanical prostheses require long-term curative anticoagulation. Only VKAs are recommended. The effectiveness of anticoagulation is assessed by measuring the INR. INR monitoring is therefore essential, given the risk of prosthesis thrombosis and the serious consequences of such thrombosis.

The INR should be measured in the laboratory at least once a month, and more regularly if necessary (fluctuating INR, clinical situations causing biological changes). Recently, the CoaguChek¬Æ INRange system enables patients to measure their INR themselves at home, which means more regular monitoring. It is now reimbursed for adult patients with mechanical prostheses.

The INR target is defined by cardiologists on an individual basis. The type of prosthesis, the position of the prosthesis, and the risk factors must be taken into account:

| Thrombotic Risk of the Prosthesis | No Risk Factors | ‚â• 1 Risk Factor |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Low                               | 2.5             | 3.0             |

**Low-risk prosthesis:** Medtronic-Hall¬Æ (disc valve), Saint-Jude¬Æ and CarboMedics¬Æ (double-finned valves) aortic position prosthesis.

**Intermediate-risk prosthesis:** Bj√∂rk-Shiley¬Æ type aortic prosthesis (monodisc) and all other double-finned, non-low-risk prostheses.

**Description:** Understanding the role and procedures of collegial deliberation in end-of-life situations.

**Rubric:** Management

When a person being kept alive artificially or at the end of their life is unable to express themselves, the decision to continue, limit, or stop treatment rests with the doctor.

To assist the doctor in making the best decision for the patient, the law provides for a ""collegial procedure,"" which involves a series of steps to be taken collectively. This procedure may be requested by the doctor, the medical team, or by the family and close friends based on any advance directives. The final decision rests with the doctor, who must provide reasons for the decision and document it in the patient's medical file. The procedure involves consultation between the doctor in charge of the patient and at least one other outside doctor who acts as a consultant. They must be consulted and listened to, even if their requests cannot always be met. The procedure seeks to establish the person's wishes by examining the advance directives or, if unavailable, by the testimony of the trusted support person, or failing that, by the family or one of the patient's close friends. The main situations requiring this procedure prior to any decision are unreasonable obstinacy and deep and continuous sedation until death (DCSD).

**Ethical Issues**

Clinical situations are often complex and uncertain. A poor prognosis or the risk of death should not necessarily lead to the implementation of deep and continuous sedation, even if active treatments are stopped. Preventive deep and continuous sedation is not a systematic response. It is important to consider other medicinal and non-medicinal alternatives to address the suffering of patients by adapting care as closely as possible to their requests and needs.

The CCNE (opinion 139 published on 13 September 2022) emphasizes two fundamental principles that must be reconciled: the ""duty of solidarity"" towards the most vulnerable and ""respect for the autonomy of the individual."" Ethical deliberation involves assessing the value of the right to life. If the right to life is given supreme and indisputable value, any compromise is unthinkable, and the debate is closed. If respect for the ""right to life"" does not amount to a ""duty to live"" a life deemed unbearable by the person living it, then there is no obligation to live, and the debate remains open.

**Good Practice**

The collegial procedure must always consist of a deliberative process and not be reduced to its procedural dimension. In this spirit, each participant in this collegial procedure must be able to argue and then debate within an interdisciplinary consultation, without ranking the arguments according to the role of the professionals present. Each person's position must be able to evolve under the influence of the arguments of others to arrive at a fair and proportionate assessment in the interests of the person being cared for. This process requires a wide range of skills, time, and availability. It must be recorded in writing in the patient's medical record.",0.9285714285714286,20.13379310344828,False,True,0.7238423228263855,0.7225550015767416,c,False,4,3

**Title:** Knowing the Principles of the Synacthen Test  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Additional Tests  

SynACTHene¬Æ (tetracosactide) is an ACTH analogue. It directly explores primary adrenal insufficiency and indirectly the possibility of corticotropic insufficiency by testing for adrenal atrophy resulting from the lack of stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH.

**The Synacthen Test Consists of:**

- Cortisol measurement before the test (at 8 hours)
- IM or IV administration of a 250 ¬µg ampoule of tetracosactide
- Followed by a cortisol measurement at 1 hour (+/- 30 min)

**Interpretation:**

- Peak cortisol < 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) indicates no response to the Synacthen test, suggesting adrenal insufficiency, regardless of the aetiology.
- Cortisolemia ‚â• 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) indicates a normal response, ruling out adrenal insufficiency except in cases of recent or partial adrenocortical insufficiency. This is because the adrenal cortex is not atrophied and can respond to a high dose of exogenous ACTH during the test (e.g., acquired corticotropic insufficiency following surgery for a pituitary adenoma, when the corticotropic axis was normal pre-operatively).

**Additional Stimulation Tests:**

- Two other stimulation tests can be conducted in a hospital setting: insulin hypoglycaemia or the Metopirone test.

If the pre-test cortisol is <5 ng/ml (138 nmol/l), the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is made without the need for a SynACTHene stimulation test.

== Mechanisms of Action ==

- **Metformin:** Inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, increase in peripheral glucose uptake (muscles).
- **Sulfonylurea:** Stimulation of insulin release by the pancreas.
- **Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) Inhibitors:** Inhibition of the degradation of incretins by DPP-4, allowing incretins to stimulate insulin release and inhibit the release of glucagon by the pancreas. The mechanism of action is glucose-dependent, meaning DPP-4 inhibitors do not stimulate insulin release when blood glucose levels are low.
- **GLP-1 Agonists:** An analogue of an incretin (GLP-1) that is resistant to DPP-4, enabling it to stimulate the release of insulin and inhibit the release of glucagon from the pancreas.
- **Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter Type 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors:** Reduce glucose reabsorption in the renal tubule, facilitating urinary glucose excretion and osmotic diuresis (benefit demonstrated in heart failure).

== Indication ==

Type 2 diabetes (drug prescription, follow-up consultation, and education for a patient with type 2 diabetes or secondary diabetes).

== Adverse Reactions ==

- **Metformin:** Digestive problems (very common), lactic acidosis (very rare).
- **Sulfonylurea:** Hypoglycemia, weight gain.
- **Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) Inhibitors:** Arthralgia (uncommon), pancreatitis (very rare).
- **GLP-1 Agonists:** Digestive disorders (very common), pancreatitis (very rare).
- **Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter Type 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors:** Urogenital infections (frequent), sometimes serious (necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum), arterial hypotension, polyuria, ketoacidosis (rare).

== Drug Interactions ==

- **Metformin:**
  - Drugs likely to promote nephropathy: iodinated contrast products (combination not recommended during the examination and for at least 48 hours after injection), NSAIDs (monitor renal function).
  - Drugs that inhibit the renal secretion systems of metformin (dolutegravir).

- **Sulfonylurea:**
  - Increased risk of hypoglycemia: miconazole (contraindicated for certain sulfonamides), beta blockers.

- **Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) Inhibitors:**
  - Converting enzyme inhibitor: increased risk of angioedema (vildagliptin).
  - Numerous interactions with saxagliptin, which is largely metabolized by CYP 450 3A4, unlike sitagliptin and vildagliptin.

- **GLP-1 Agonists:** Low potential for clinically significant interaction.

- **Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter Type 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors:**
  - Diuretic (increased risk of hypotension, dehydration).
  - Hypoglycemic sulfonamide, insulin (increased risk of hypoglycemia).

== Monitoring ==

Intravitreal haemorrhage causes a drop in visual acuity, often preceded by an impression of ""sooty rain.""

The reduction in visual acuity varies greatly depending on the extent of the haemorrhage. A minimal intravitreal haemorrhage may manifest mainly as myodesopsia, with no reduction or minimal reduction in visual acuity. A massive intravitreal haemorrhage leads to a severe reduction in visual acuity, with visual acuity reduced to light perception at most.

The cause of the haemorrhage is easy to recognize when the retina remains visible. In other cases, massive haemorrhage renders the retina invisible on fundus examination. B ultrasound can then sometimes point to an aetiology, such as evidence of a retinal tear. B ultrasound is always indicated when the retina is not visible to rule out the presence of retinal detachment.

The main causes of intravitreal haemorrhage are as follows:

- Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
- Ischaemic occlusions of the central retinal vein or one of its branches
- Retinal tear: A retinal tear, whether or not complicated by retinal detachment, may result in intravitreal haemorrhage due to rupture of a retinal vessel.

**Definitions**

Allergic contact dermatitis is an allergic hypersensitivity specific to a given antigen (called an ""allergen""). It is an adaptive inflammatory reaction mediated by CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells). It is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or type IV in the Gel and Coombs classification. The Type IV delayed hypersensitivity is illustrated in the Gel and Coombs classification.

**Pathophysiological Phases**

1. **Asymptomatic Sensitisation Phase:** In non-sensitised individuals, the allergen penetrates the epidermis and is picked up by skin dendritic cells, which migrate to the lymph nodes and present the allergen to na√Øve LTCD8+. The na√Øve LTCD8+ that recognise the allergen then differentiate into cytotoxic memory LTCD8+, which circulate throughout the body, particularly in the skin. This sensitisation phase is asymptomatic and may last from a few days to a few years. The onset of sensitisation is correlated with the duration of exposure and the concentration of the allergen.

2. **Symptomatic Phase (Allergic Contact Dermatitis):** When the skin comes into contact with the allergen again, the allergen-specific memory LTCD8+ react against the epithelial cells covered with allergen and trigger an inflammatory reaction. This is expressed clinically in the form of eczema and histologically in the form of an infiltrate of lymphocytes in the epidermis (exocytosis) and epidermal oedema (spongiosis). It takes 24 to 48 hours for contact eczema to appear after contact with the allergen in an already sensitised individual.

**Rubric:** Definition  

**Selection and Ranking Biases**

Selection and ranking biases can be:

- **Non-differential**: The risk of bias is identical in each of the groups studied (defined by the exposure factor or endpoint of interest). This type of bias results in a loss of power, i.e., it tends to bias the results of the study in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference.
- **Differential**: The risk of bias differs according to the group studied (defined by the exposure factor or the endpoint of interest). This type of bias can influence the outcome of the study either in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference or in favor of the alternative hypothesis of the presence of a difference.

**Selection Bias**

- **Nondifferential**: Occurs when the study population is not a representative sample of the population of interest, which will pose problems of external validity.
- **Differential**: Occurs if the way patients are selected differs between the study groups. Randomization prevents initial differential selection bias. However, during follow-up, patients who are lost to follow-up or withdraw their consent for one of the exposure groups or for the risk of the event of interest will result in a differential selection bias. To minimize these biases, it is necessary to ensure that the selection and follow-up of subjects are as independent of the exposure group and event risk as possible.

**Classification Bias**

- **Nondifferential**: Occurs when the classification error on the judgment criterion (respectively on the exposure) occurs with the same probability in exposed and unexposed people (respectively according to the judgment criterion). It produces an underestimate of the association, in other words, bringing the value of the RR or OR closer to 1.
- **Differential**: Occurs if the way in which the data are collected (whether exposure or judgment criterion) differs according to the group (exposure or judgment criterion). In clinical trials, blinding prevents these biases; in observational studies, it is a major risk. In particular, in case-control studies, the classic example is exposure recall bias: cases remember more or make more effort to seek out information about their exposure, whereas this is often under-reported by controls. Generally speaking, these biases can be limited by using data collection procedures that are as standardized and objective as possible, and that are similar for all subjects included in the study.",0.8,17.861666666666668,False,True,0.717022716999054,0.8660696347554525,b,False,2,3

**IV) Intestinal ischaemia** (in French)

- Digestive ischaemia corresponds to an ""arterial perfusion insufficiency"" linked to a ""chronic"" obstacle (most often of atheromatous origin) or an ""acute"" obstacle (by embolism, in situ thrombosis, or dissection) of the digestive arteries. ""Abdominal pain (SD-004)""; ""Chronic pain (SD-035)"".
- There are three digestive arteries: the celiac trunk, the superior mesenteric artery, and the inferior mesenteric artery. The three territories are linked by anastomotic circulation. The superior mesenteric artery is the main artery of the digestive tract.

- Chronic intestinal ischaemia: Digestive blood flow depends on the metabolic needs of the digestive tract and represents between 20 and 35% of the body's total oxygen consumption. When metabolic demand increases in the post-prandial period, splanchnic blood flow is increased. Hyperaemia is maximal in the hour following the arrival of ingested food and lasts around 5 hours. In the event of arterial obstruction, the relative post-prandial hypoperfusion explains the ischaemia responsible for the pain. The intensity and duration of symptoms are proportional to the volume and composition of the food ingested and the degree of hypoperfusion. ""Abdominal pain (SD-004)""; ""Chronic pain (SD-035)"".

- Acute intestinal ischaemia: In the event of acute arterial occlusion or low flow, intestinal ischaemia occurs. The consequences of this ischaemia may be reversible in the first few hours if arterial flow is restored, but if the ischaemia becomes permanent, it leads to a mesenteric infarction.

**Knowing How to Interview a Patient in Pain and Assess the Components and Consequences of Pain**

- Diagnosis and assessment of pain intensity using a validated self-assessment scale (EVA, EN, EVS) must be actively undertaken by carers without waiting for the complaint. It is compulsory and must be recorded in the patient's file, regardless of the reason for hospitalization.

- It is an essential prerequisite for initiating treatment and can be carried out by any healthcare professional (medical students, doctors, psychologists, physiotherapists, nurses, midwives, dentists, pharmacists).

- Diagnosis and assessment of acute and chronic pain

**Objectives**

- Screening and diagnosis of the nature of the patient's pain (acute or chronic, neuropathic, nociceptive, nociplastic, visceral, mixed).

- Evaluate the location of the pain, whether it is diffuse or focal, whether it is radiating, its characteristics (type of pain, factors reducing or increasing the pain, etc.), associated symptoms and clinical signs (nausea, vomiting, fever, redness on inspection, tenderness on palpation of the abdomen, etc.).

- Assess the intensity of the pain by encouraging the patient to self-assess using validated scales (EN 0-10 oral or visual and VAS: pain intensity mild if <4, moderate between 4 and 6, severe if > 6, EVS in 5 descriptors).

- Evaluate the efficacy, tolerance, and compliance with analgesic treatment, whether medicinal or not.

- The specific objectives of the interview and assessment differ depending on whether the pain is acute or chronic.

- In the case of acute pain (more often nociceptive, traumatic, or post-operative), the therapeutic objective is curative, and aetiological treatment is possible. Assessment is generally limited to the pain area, pain intensity (rest, effort), consumption of analgesics, and sometimes associated anxiety.

- In the case of chronic pain (a ""multi-dimensional"" entity with sensory, emotional, cognitive, and behavioural components), the objectives are symptomatic, and aetiological treatment is rarely possible (HAS 1999 recommendations). Assessment takes time and can be spread over several consultations.

- It involves an etiological assessment with an interview, a clinical examination, and, if necessary, additional tests.

**Knowledge of Pain Assessment Tools and Scales for Communicating and Non-Communicating Adults**

**General Principles**

- Always use the same scale for the same patient unless there are changes in cognitive ability.

- If the patient has several sites of pain, each site should be assessed separately.

**Self-Assessment Scales for Pain and Its Impact**

- Aimed at communicating patients, i.e., children over the age of 6 or adults able to communicate verbally (no major cognitive disorders or disorders of consciousness).

- They mainly comprise ""pain intensity scales"" and ""multidimensional scales.""

- Intensity scales can be used to assess the intensity of pain at the present time or over the last 24 hours, and if necessary, to identify the 'emergency' to be treated, the level of painkillers to be used, the evolution of the pain, and the patient's level of relief.

- Multidimensional scales take into account different aspects of chronic pain and its repercussions. The most widely used is the McGill Pain Questionnaire (French version: questionnaire douleur de Saint Antoine), which explores the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. These scales should only be used in the management of chronic pain.

- The assessment of chronic pain can be supplemented by scales for depression, anxiety, quality of life, and sleep, which are not specific to pain. The most widely used scale is the Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), which assesses the anxiety and/or depression component in chronic pain patients.

**Pain Intensity Scales**

- **The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS):** This generally takes the form of a 100 mm ruler, horizontal (adult) or vertical (child), with one end corresponding to ""no pain"" and the other to ""maximum imaginable pain."" On the side presented to the patient, there is a cursor that the patient can move to the point where they feel the most pain. On the other side are scales seen by the carer, enabling them to determine the precise intensity of the pain (in cm or mm).

- **The Numerical Scale (EN):** Provides a numerical scoring system with or without visual support. Patients are asked to quantify the intensity of their pain from 0 to 10 at a given moment. Visual support can help in critical situations (pre-hospital, emergency, intensive care, post-interventional care room) or with less cooperative patients (asthenia, fatigability).

- **The Simple Verbal Scale (SVS) (or categorical scale):** Aimed at patients who are generally unable to use the previous ones. Includes qualifiers such as: no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, very severe pain. The EVS should not be simplified to the simple question ""are you in pain?""

**Pain Hetero-Assessment Scales**

- They are aimed at patients with verbal communication disorders.

- They require the clinician to observe the patient's pain behaviour and quantify it using a validated score: these scales are also known as behavioural scales. Each type of population (young children, post-operative young children, non-communicative elderly people, confused or sedated adult patients) has its own behavioural scales, validated in each typical population.

- The areas of behavioural observation most frequently used in these scales are:

  - Facial expression (mimicry, grimace) and crying
  - Vocalization or verbalization of pain
  - Hypertonia and movement of the limbs, agitation or absence of movement, interruption of movement, etc.
  - Usual activities

- Each hetero-evaluation scale has a threshold score which has been defined as being associated with pain of significant intensity. These thresholds imply that clinicians should consider the search for the cause of the pain and its treatment.",0.75,14.040000000000003,False,True,0.7230076193809509,0.6964451670646667,a,True,4,3

**Title:** Knowing the Principles of Emergency Treatment  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Emergency Identification  

The therapeutic strategy for acute ischaemia aims to:

- **Prevent the thrombus from spreading and embolic recurrence:** Anticoagulant treatment with heparin must be started as soon as the clinical diagnosis is made. (""Prescription and follow-up of treatment with anticoagulant (SD-248)"")

- **Ensure revascularisation of the ischaemic territory:** This is a surgical emergency. After six hours of sensory-motor ischaemia, there is a major risk of amputation. Intraoperative arteriography may be used to guide the surgical procedure. (""Preoperative explanations and consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure"")

  - In the case of embolism in a healthy artery, embolectomy with a Fogarty probe is the surgical method of choice.
  - In the case of thrombosis in a pathological artery, revascularisation is performed using conventional techniques (endarterectomy, bypass surgery) and/or endovascular techniques (recanalisation, angioplasty, thromboaspiration, in situ thrombolysis), depending on the type of lesion. Caution: intra-arterial in situ thrombolysis administered over 12 to 24 hours is contraindicated in patients with sensory-motor ischaemia because it takes too long to take effect.
  - In the event of late revascularisation or aorto-iliac thrombosis, limb lavage should be discussed to prevent the systemic effects of the release of products of muscle catabolism into the general circulation (revascularisation syndrome).
  - Limb amputation may be performed immediately when ischaemia has been overcome, or secondarily to control the major metabolic disorders of a revascularisation syndrome, or after revascularisation has failed.

- **Correct pathological processes aggravating ischaemia:**
  - A leg aponevrotomy will be performed in cases of acute compartment syndrome (muscular oedema as a reaction to revascularisation, within the inextensible aponeurotic envelope of the leg). A leg aponevrotomy will be discussed when revascularisation is carried out late.
  - Do not forget to manage low cardiac output, hypovolaemia, and rhythm disorders.

- **Cellular lysis induced by ischaemia:** This leads to the release of potassium and myoglobin into the bloodstream during revascularisation, resulting in metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiac rhythm disorders, which are exacerbated by hyperkalaemia and acidosis and can result in cardiac arrest.

- **Pain control:** Level 3 analgesics are necessary from the outset and must be adapted to the pain after revascularisation.

- **Protect the ischaemic limb:** The risk of very rapid onset of pressure sores and skin lesions requires immediate nursing care, prolonged until revascularisation. It is important to protect the limb, avoid compression points, and avoid using adhesives on ischaemic skin.",1.0,13.860000000000003,False,True,0.788109540939331,0.6330872575441996,b,False,2,4

The linchpin of the coordinated care pathway is the ""preferred doctor"" that each insured person or entitled person aged 16 or over has declared, with their consent, to their health insurance organization.

The chosen treating doctor may be a general practitioner or a specialist. He or she may be a hospital doctor. Patients are free to change their choice at any time.

The attending physician:

- Provides care on a regular basis.
- Guides patients through the coordinated care pathway, connecting them with other healthcare professionals (other specialists, hospital doctors, etc.).
- Manages the medical file, centralizing all information relating to care and state of health. It keeps the medical record up to date (test results, diagnoses, treatments, etc.). If the patient has created a shared medical record (formerly a personal medical record), they can access all the data stored in it by healthcare professionals.
- Provides personalized prevention: vaccination follow-up, organized screening tests (e.g., colorectal cancer screening), help to stop smoking, health advice based on lifestyle, age, or family history, nutritional advice, etc.
- Establishes the care protocol if the patient is affected by a long-term condition. Care will be reimbursed at 100% by the Assurance Maladie.

Patients remain free not to have recourse to their GP or not to comply with his or her referral prescriptions. However, patients who do not wish to join the scheme will have their out-of-pocket expenses increased. When a patient consults a specialist directly without being referred by their GP, they are subject to an increase in co-payment (70% instead of 30%). Specialist doctors may charge extra fees when they see a patient who has not previously been referred to them by a regular doctor as part of the coordinated care pathway. These extra fees are payable by the patient.

Some doctors are directly accessible:

- The gynecologist, for periodic clinical examinations, including screening, prescription and monitoring of contraception, pregnancy monitoring, or medical termination of pregnancy.
- The ophthalmologist, for prescriptions and renewals of glasses or contact lenses, and glaucoma screening and monitoring.
- The psychiatrist or neuropsychiatrist for people aged between 16 and 25.
- The stomatologist, for oral and dental procedures (preventive oral and dental care, conservative care, surgery, dental prostheses, dento-maxillo-facial orthopedic treatment).

**Rubric:** Definition

The Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM) manages the risks of sickness, maternity, disability, and death, as well as accidents at work and occupational diseases. Its main mission is to ""pay for the care provided to insured persons."" It also contributes to improving the health of the population, the efficiency of the healthcare system, and the control of healthcare expenditure. To fulfill its missions, health insurance has several levers of intervention including:

- Definition of the ""scope of reimbursable procedures"" based on medical recommendations and opinions issued by the French National Authority for Health (HAS)
- Pricing of procedures and level of reimbursement: common classification of medical procedures (CCAM), activity-based pricing (T2A) for health establishments, and general nomenclature of professional procedures

Within the framework of the Union Nationale des Caisses d'Assurance Maladie (UNCAM), which groups together the national health insurance schemes (the general scheme and the MSA), it conducts the ""conventionnelle policy"" (relations between health professionals and the health insurance scheme, in particular the tariffs for procedures including consultations).

The health insurance scheme contributes to better matching of healthcare provision to the needs of insured persons within the framework of the regional health agencies, informing insured persons about the characteristics of local healthcare provision and the proper use of healthcare products. It participates in the prevention policy (cancer screening) and develops a support system for patients with serious pathologies (monitoring diabetic patients as part of the Sophia programme, for example).

Sickness insurance contributes to the dissemination of HAS recommendations to professionals (carried out by sickness insurance delegates) and draws up comparative profiles of activity and prescriptions.

Finally, the health insurance scheme is responsible for the medical control of expenditure. Within each region, the health insurance scheme participates in the development, under the aegis of the ARS, of a regional multi-annual risk management programme which complements the national risk management programmes.",0.5,12.775000000000002,False,True,0.7162410616874695,0.6870392163594564,d,False,5,4

**Title:** Knowing the Principles of the Therapeutic Management of Hyperthyroidism  
**Rubric:** Management  

The majority of thyrotoxicoses can be treated on an outpatient basis following a consultation.

You need to know how to identify the rare emergency situations that require immediate treatment or even hospitalization:

- Acute thyrotoxic crisis (Hyperthermia/fever SD-044, Tachycardia SD-166, Diarrhoea SD-002)
- Cardiothyreosis in an elderly person or one with heart disease (Palpitations SD-165, Tachycardia SD-166)
- Malignant orbitopathy (Diplopia SD-143)
- Cachectic form in elderly patients or those with another chronic disease

Treatment of hyperthyroidism includes symptomatic treatment of thyrotoxicosis and specific treatment of hyperthyroidism.

Symptomatic treatments include:

- Rest
- Beta-blockers, particularly non-cardioselective beta-blockers (after eliminating any contraindications) to reduce tachycardia and tremors of the extremities
- Sedatives or benzodiazepines for behavioral problems such as agitation or incapacitating insomnia

The specific treatments for hyperthyroidism are:

- Synthetic antithyroid drugs, in combination with effective contraception and monitoring of hepatic and hematological tolerance
- Total thyroidectomy resulting in hypothyroidism, with definitive replacement
- Treatment with radioactive iodine, in the absence of contraindication (pregnancy; progressive or severe or very inflammatory orbitopathy)

The choice of treatment depends on the cause of the hyperthyroidism (Basedow, toxic multinodular goitre, toxic adenoma, or hyperthyroidism induced by iodine overload; thyroiditis) and the context (patient's age, patient's request, desire for pregnancy, drug tolerance).

Graves' disease can occur as a single episode, but the risk of recurrence is 40-60% after well-managed treatment.

In pregnant women:

- Treatment of Graves' disease during pregnancy requires specialized management to discuss the indication for a low-dose synthetic antithyroid drug, to limit teratogenicity and to determine monitoring procedures, as spontaneous remissions are frequent in the second half of pregnancy.
- The differential diagnosis to be aware of is transient gestational thyrotoxicosis, which is more common than Graves' disease in pregnancy (2% of pregnancies, negative TSH receptor antibodies, and occasional hyperthyroidism in the 1st trimester of pregnancy).",0.8571428571428571,18.804705882352945,False,True,0.7878984212875366,0.7234376867612203,b,False,3,3

**Rubric:** Definition  

**Definitions**

**Nested Case-Control Study:** A case-control study in which cases and controls are selected from subjects in a cohort that has already been established. Subjects who developed the event of interest during follow-up are included as ""cases,"" and subjects who did not develop the event after an equivalent length of follow-up are included as ""controls."" These cases and controls can be re-contacted to collect data retrospectively on more specific exposures that were not collected prospectively as part of the cohort, without having to re-contact all the subjects in the initial cohort.

**Case-Cohort Study:** From an existing cohort, a sample called the ""sub-cohort"" is selected at random (i.e., representative of the entire cohort). All the incident 'cases' in the cohort (all the individuals who have experienced the event of interest, whether or not from the sub-cohort) are selected and compared with the 'non-cases' in the sub-cohort only. This scheme is used in particular when the study requires additional data to be collected. In order to avoid collecting data on the entire initial cohort, only cases (from the entire cohort) and ""non-cases"" (from the sub-cohort) are collected. For example, the association between a genetic anomaly and the occurrence of cancer (the genetic anomaly will only be measured in cancer cases and non-cases in the sub-cohort).

**Quasi-Experimental Study:** Quasi-experimental studies aim to evaluate the effect on a judgment criterion of an experimental intervention, conducted on an individual or population scale, i.e., administered to all or some of the subjects in a population or sample as part of a study, outside a randomized trial. In practice:

- No control group, for example in:
  - A repeated cross-sectional before/after survey design of an intervention conducted on an experimental basis in a population to compare the prevalence of the event of interest between the two periods. The problem is the possible existence of a period effect: we do not know how this prevalence changes over the same period for a population where the intervention was not administered.
  - A cohort design in which all the subjects included receive an experimental intervention on inclusion, or during follow-up, and in which the incidence rate of the event of interest, or its evolution before/after the intervention, is studied in an almost descriptive manner; this incidence rate may be compared with known rates in the source population.

- Control group but not determined by drawing lots, for example in:
  - A here-elsewhere study design in which prevalences or incidence rates of the event of interest are compared (by single or repeated cross-sectional surveys, or as part of cohort surveys) between geographical regions, some of which are selected (but not drawn at random) to receive an intervention on an experimental basis in a population.
  - A cohort survey design in which some of the subjects (not selected at random) are selected to receive an experimental intervention.

**Study on Grouped (Aggregated) Data:** We do not know the individual status of the health phenomenon of interest, but we can estimate its frequency at the level of a group of subjects (defined, for example, on a geographical criterion: region, country). This is the case when we have a registration system that lists all the subjects who have developed the event of interest during a given period in a given population (e.g., cancer registry, notifiable diseases). To estimate the frequency of the event of interest in this population, we can use census data, for example, which will give us the total size of the population over the period for the denominator. These frequencies can be compared between several populations or over time. When different recording systems are available to estimate the frequency of the event of interest and that of exposure factors in groups of subjects, it is also possible to compare the joint changes in these frequencies over time or space. Example: estimate changes in the age- and sex-standardized cancer incidence rate in France between 1990 and 2020 using cancer registries, compare these incidence rates between different regions, study the correlation between changes in these incidence rates and changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption over the same period.",0.5,8.009090909090911,False,True,0.7871028780937195,0.668735941251119,d,False,2,3

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

Thromboembolic venous disease (TEVD) is a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency, as it can be life-threatening in the case of PE.

== Clinical Suspicion: Clinical Signs ==  
The clinical presentation of VTE is polymorphous.

**Suspicion of DVT:**

- Spontaneous pain in the lower limb
- Unilateral oedema
- Superficial venous dilatation in the absence of varicose veins

The more abrupt the onset and the more unilateral the signs, the more valuable they are. DVT may also be asymptomatic and be discovered in the setting of PE or during routine screening.

**Suspicion of PE:**

- Basi- or latero-thoracic pain
- Dyspnoea
- Haemoptoic sputum
- Tachycardia
- Lipothymia
- Syncope
- Haemodynamic failure with signs of shock and right heart

As in the case of DVT, these signs are not always present and may be encountered in other clinical situations. Dyspnoea is all the more suggestive if there is no other obvious cause (pneumopathy, OAP, etc.). Finally, PE can be asymptomatic, discovered by chance on a chest scan prescribed for another indication.

== Clinical Probability Scores ==  
There are several clinical probability scores, in particular the Wells DVT score for the diagnosis of DVT, and the Wells PE and Geneva scores for PE. They are divided into 2 (not probable / probable) or 3 (low / intermediate / high) probability classes. In particular, they are used to guide the performance of additional tests, D-dimers, and imaging.

== D-dimer ==  
- Fibrin degradation products  
- Determination by ELISA or turbidimetric latex techniques  
- Elevated levels in situations other than VTE (elderly subjects, pregnancy, infection, inflammation, cancer, COPD, etc.)  
- Non-specific  
- High negative predictive value  

== Imaging ==  
**DVT:** Venous Doppler ultrasound performed in decubitus position.  
**PE:** Thoracic angioscanner.  

- Certain situations may require ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy.  
- If there is a contraindication to either of these tests, the diagnosis is made if there is a clinical probability of PE and evidence of proximal DVT on venous Doppler ultrasound.

== Diagnostic Algorithms ==  
In the case of a high clinical probability score:

- Start anticoagulant treatment before the results of imaging tests
- If the initial imaging is negative, further investigations should be carried out before completely ruling out the diagnosis of PE by performing a venous Doppler ultrasound or a ventilation/perfusion lung scan or a thoracic angioscanner which would not have been performed before considering stopping anticoagulant treatment.

== Differential Diagnoses ==  
Bilateral, comparative, and exhaustive venous Doppler ultrasound can be used to identify differential diagnoses such as popliteal cyst rupture, intramuscular haematoma, muscle tear, etc. Thoracic angioscanner can be used to diagnose thoracic pathologies that mimic PE (pneumopathy, bronchopulmonary cancer, etc).",0.875,11.863529411764706,False,True,0.7614826560020447,0.5407067537307739,c,False,4,2

**For the patient, the aims of SMBG are:**

- To monitor their diabetes
- Adapt insulin doses
- Provide an idea of the average glycaemic balance
- Manage emergency situations (e.g., Hypoglycaemia (SD-209), Hyperglycaemia (SD-208))

Patients should be aware that HbA1c is used to estimate blood glucose control over the 2 to 3 months prior to blood sampling, and should know their HbA1c target.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels should be carried out by the patient 4-6 times a day. For a long time, self-monitoring of blood glucose was based on capillary blood tests obtained by finger pricking. The availability, with reimbursement, of glucose sensors that measure glucose levels continuously has revolutionized the monitoring of insulin-treated diabetes.

In the presence of unexplained and prolonged hyperglycaemia, possibly associated with digestive symptoms, patients are taught to look for the presence of ketone bodies in the urine or in the blood using capillary sampling, in order to detect ketotic decompensation at an early stage.

The power of a study is its ability to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. This is most often the ability to show a difference if it exists (in a randomized superiority trial), or an association if it exists (in a cohort or case-control study). More rarely, power may be the ability to show an absence of difference (non-inferiority trial or equivalence trial).

The power of a statistical test is influenced by several parameters:

- **Size of sample analyzed (N):** If N increases, power increases.
- **Difference to be detected (d):** If d increases, power increases.
- **Variability of observations (variance):** If variance increases, power decreases.
- **Alpha risk:** If alpha increases, power increases.
- **One-tailed or two-tailed test:** If the test is one-tailed, the power increases.

In practice, the only parameters that can really be controlled in a biomedical study are the alpha risk (which is set), the construction of a one- or two-tailed test, and the sample size (determined by calculating the number of subjects required).",1.0,10.562500000000004,False,True,0.7537139654159546,0.6227733095486959,c,True,2,4

- **Type I Hyperthyroidism**: Functional form (previously pathological thyroid) characterized by excess synthesis and pre-existing nodular thyroid pathology.
- **Type II Hyperthyroidism**: Lesional form (thyroiditis with release of preformed thyroid hormones, no pre-existing thyroid pathology).

In the absence of TSH receptor antibodies, the differential diagnosis between these two forms depends on ultrasound and thyroid scintigraphy.

Patients treated with amiodarone exhibit a non-pathological biological characteristic: a slightly elevated T4L concentration (due to inhibition of T4 deiodase), which contrasts with normal TSH and T3L concentrations.

A single injection of iodinated contrast product can saturate the thyroid with iodine for 4 to 6 weeks, sometimes inducing transient hyperthyroidism that is generally not very symptomatic.

Anti-cancer immunotherapy frequently leads to thyroiditis, with a transient phase of hyperthyroidism, often followed by a phase of hypothyroidism, which can sometimes be permanent.",0.8,15.99857142857143,False,True,0.706946611404419,0.99268772204717,b,False,2,4

The aim of no-fault liability is to compensate the victim (or their heirs) for the loss suffered ""without having to prove fault"" on the part of the person who caused the loss.

== Role of ONIAM ==

In the event of a medical accident, the victim (or their heirs) may refer the matter to the Commission de Conciliation et d'Indemnisation (CCI) in their region. In the case of no-fault liability, the victim will be compensated by the Office National d'Indemnisation des Accidents M√©dicaux, des Affections Iatrog√®nes et des Infections Nosocomiales (ONIAM) on the basis of national solidarity.

**Title:** Person of Trust  
**Description:** Understanding the role of the trusted support person in providing information and obtaining consent. Familiarity with the conditions for their appointment and roles.  
**Rubric:** Management  

The right to appoint a trusted support person is enshrined in article L.1111-6 of the CSP (public health code). Healthcare teams have long been concerned with how a person close to the patient, as a third party and mediator, can help build links in the care process and give the patient a voice, particularly when the patient is unable or unwilling to participate in the decision alone. This reflection led to the introduction of the concept of the ""trusted support person"" in the ""health democracy"" law of 4 March 2002.

The role of the trusted support person is to assist the patient in their care, support them physically and/or psychologically, and liaise with medical teams once the patient has designated one (a designation that allows the confidentiality of information to be shared). They support the patient's day-to-day care, choices, and decisions.

This primary role deserves emphasis because the trusted support person is sometimes seen only as an interlocutor in major crisis situations, such as stopping or limiting care at the end of life or the question of post-mortem organ removal, where they testify to the patient's wishes. The role of the trusted support person is important.

Even outside the hospital setting, anyone receiving care in our healthcare system may feel the need to be accompanied by someone close, regardless of the status of their illness. Additionally, any citizen, even if not ill, who receives a healthcare service (e.g., screening, preventive action, blood tests, X-rays) may wish to be accompanied by someone. Anyone can accidentally face a complex end-of-life decision. From a collective point of view, this possibility of designation should be offered to all citizens as soon as they meet their doctor, as the law provides for the trusted support person to be consulted to testify to the subject's wishes regarding decisions to stop or limit life-sustaining treatment or post-mortem organ removal.

The appointment of a trusted support person must extend beyond severe pathologies and hospitalization to become a civic option available to everyone, regardless of clinical condition. In practice, patients and their families are not necessarily familiar with this procedure. It is the duty of every healthcare provider and institution to offer it.

The first step is to explain that any adult relative can be a trusted support person: brother, sister, parent, grandparent, uncle, aunt, spouse, partner, friend, member of an association, etc. Explain to the patient the purpose of this appointment, while also explaining that it is not compulsory. It is a possibility that patients must be able to choose, especially if they wish to keep the secret completely or protect those close to them by keeping their illness a secret.

In previous years, designated trusted third parties were sometimes unaware they had been chosen by a patient, as they were not present or involved in the designation process, raising doubts about their legitimacy in ethical discussions concerning the patient. This is why the designation, made in writing by the patient, must be co-signed by the designated person. The procedure for designating and collecting information from the trusted support person must be properly organized, ensuring a reference person within the healthcare team is responsible for informing the patient and then the designated person.

The role of the carer is to advise the patient based on their experience of the illness and the sometimes complex family or emotional environment. It is important to explain that both designation and non-designation are legitimate choices. The Public Health Code stipulates an obligation to propose a trusted support person, but not an obligation to designate one. Giving patients this freedom and guiding them in their best interests is an ethical responsibility. When explanations are given, the question of breaking confidentiality with regard to the designated relative should be discussed.

Regarding the persons designated, several important points will be raised, particularly their availability and willingness to carry out this mission, which are essential to give meaning to the process. An explanation of how long the designation of a trusted support person is valid will be given: the law does not set a limit on the validity of the designation. However, the ups and downs of life and the way a patient's experience of illness evolves mean that things can change over time. The spirit of the law and the legitimate variability of a person's choices mean that the patient should be informed of the possible change of designated person. The designation can be revoked at any time by the patient. For healthcare professionals, the recommendation is to ask the patient each time they are admitted to the hospital again, or each time they undergo a new cycle of care, whether the designated person will remain in place.

In conclusion, the designation should be made in writing, signed by the patient and the designated person, and recorded in the medical record, with precise contact details and the nature of the relationship between the patient and the designated person, including any updates.",0.6,9.255714285714287,False,True,0.7867000102996826,0.7033920685450236,b,False,5,2

**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

Haemorrhoidal disease refers to all complaints associated with changes in haemorrhoidal tissue. It is referred to as an ""attack"" when complaints are of short duration and include a painful component, or as a chronic disease when signs are regular. Symptoms are usually accompanied by a morphological change in the haemorrhoids, but there is no anatomo-clinical correlation (people can complain of small haemorrhoids, or have large haemorrhoids without feeling them). The pathogenesis of haemorrhoidal disease is only partially understood. There are two theories that lead to a normal, asymptomatic anatomical component becoming symptomatic: the mechanical theory and the vascular theory.

- **Mechanical Theory:** This theory is based on a weakening of the support tissue or anchoring material of the internal haemorrhoids. Long bowel movements, straining (dyschesia), changes in stool consistency (hard stools), and childbirth are risk factors for the onset of haemorrhoidal signs. Many patients express that the onset of signs of haemorrhoidal disease coincides with childbirth.

- **Vascular Theory:** This theory likens haemorrhoidal disease to venous insufficiency. However, haemorrhoids are not veins (they do not have congenital valves) and the red bleeding of a haemorrhoidal crisis is not venous. The increase in size of haemorrhoidal tissue at the end of pregnancy and the short-term effectiveness of so-called veinotonic treatments support this hypothesis.

- Migraine-like signs, such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia, are often present but should not mislead the diagnosis.

- Attacks occur daily, often at different times of the year.

**Episodic AVF:** In 90% of patients, attacks occur for periods of a few weeks to a few months. There is sometimes a circadian cycle (seizures occur at fixed times, especially at night) and a circannual cycle (in the same season), as well as a link with alcohol consumption.

**Chronic AVF:** In 10% of cases, attacks recur over the long term with no remission of more than three months. This is then chronic AVF, a fearsome disease burdened with significant psychiatric comorbidity, including depressive signs, agoraphobia, and suicidal tendencies.

**Title:** Social Protection: Definition and Operating Principles

**Description:** Understanding the definition of social protection, social risks, and the four logics of social protection: social insurance, social assistance, universal protection, and individual or collective providence.

**Rubric:** Definition

**Social Protection** refers to all the protection mechanisms granted by a society to its members to enable them to cope with the social risks of life and their financial consequences.

Social risks are situations likely to compromise the financial security of an individual or their family by causing a fall in resources or an increase in expenditure (e.g., old age, illness, unemployment, family responsibilities).

**Four Approaches to Social Protection Coexist:**

- **Compulsory Social Insurance Approach:** Aims to protect insured persons against loss of income due to social risks. Social insurance is based on transfer mechanisms of the contribution/benefit type: social benefits are financed by social contributions deducted from income and are reserved for those who pay contributions or their beneficiaries.

- **Social Assistance Logic:** Allows solidarity to be established between individuals to combat poverty and exclusion. The benefit provides a minimum income and does not necessarily cover a specific risk (e.g., minimum social benefits such as the revenu de solidarit√© active [RSA], the allocation adulte handicap√© [AAH], or the fonds de solidarit√© vieillesse [FSV]).

- **Logic of Universal Protection:** Covers certain categories of expenditure for all individuals. Benefits are granted without means-testing and are identical for everyone (as in the case of family benefits).

- **Individual Protection Logic:** Based on savings (e.g., the decision to buy dental implants) and private insurance, while collective protection is based on the pooling of risks.",0.8333333333333334,12.62714285714286,False,True,0.7597219944000244,0.5790644884109497,b,False,2,3

**Angioscanner or Thoracic Angiotomodensitometry (Angio-CT)**

- Reference test for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE): presence of endovascular lacunae or absence of opacification of a pulmonary artery section.
- Allows a diagnosis of PE to be made or ruled out, and the main differential or associated diagnoses to be established.
- Contraindicated in cases of allergy to contrast products or severe renal insufficiency.
- Interpretation sometimes limited, particularly distally, if the quality of the examination is suboptimal.

**Ventilation-Perfusion Scintigraphy**

- Performed in the event of contraindication or unavailability of thoracic angioscanner.
- Main limitation: examination not conclusive, particularly in the case of underlying respiratory pathology.
- The indication for use in pregnant women, in particular because of less radiation to the breasts, remains debatable.
- Interpretation by comparing the perfusion images with the ventilation images and looking for areas of discrepancy (mismatch). The diagnosis of PE is made when lung segments show normal ventilation and defective perfusion.
- Result expressed in three probability classes: high probability, non-diagnostic examination, normal scintigraphy. Only a high scintigraphic probability allows a diagnosis of PE to be made.
- A normal scan rules out the diagnosis.

**Trans-Thoracic Cardiac Echography**

- Diagnostic examination in cases of suspected high-risk PE (with shock or hypotension), when the patient's condition does not allow them to be taken to the scanner.
- Direct signs: thrombus in the trunk of the pulmonary artery or in the right heart chambers (rare).

**Description:** Screening for alcohol misuse is systematic for all new patients, particularly in emergency departments, and is based on questioning, ideally with the help of the AUDIT-C questionnaire.  
**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

**Screening (Early Detection):**  
Screening must be systematic for any new patient and during emergency visits, and should be repeated. It may be initiated in response to a warning sign such as hypertension (HTA), psychological problems, or asthenia.

The assessment is based on questioning, specifically the declared alcohol consumption in standard glasses using the AUDIT-C questionnaire. Alcohol consumption exceeding the benchmarks indicates alcohol misuse, leading to an addictological assessment to clarify the diagnosis, whether it is at risk, harmful use, or dependence.

A standard glass in France contains 10 g of pure alcohol, which is approximately 10 cL of wine, 25 cL of beer at 4¬∞, or 3 cL of a strong spirit such as whisky at 40¬∞ (volumes served in a bar).

- 1 75 cL bottle of wine at 12¬∞ equals 7 standard glasses.
- 1 50 cL can of strong beer at 10¬∞ equals 4 standard glasses.

Occasional heavy drinking (IHD) is defined as the consumption of 6 or more standard drinks on one occasion.

**AUDIT-C Questionnaire:**

1. How often do you drink alcohol?
   - Never = 0
   - Once a month or less = 1
   - 2 to 4 times a month = 2
   - 2 to 3 times a week = 3
   - 4 or more times a week = 4

2. How many drinks containing alcohol do you consume on a typical drinking day?
   - Three or four = 1
   - Five or six = 2
   - Seven to nine = 3
   - Ten or more = 5

3. How often do you drink six or more glasses on a particular occasion?
   - Never = 0
   - Less than once a month = 1
   - Once a month = 2
   - Once a week = 3
   - Every day or almost every day = 4

The benefits of regular physical activity for patients suffering from a chronic disease are described in the document ""Conna√Ætre les effets positifs de l'activit√© physique dans les maladies chroniques et savoir les expliquer au patient"" (2C-249-PC-A01, source HAS).

In patients with no chronic pathology, sport has been shown to be effective in the primary prevention of all these chronic physical and mental pathologies. By improving patients' physical condition and developing their social interactions, sporting activities help to prevent the onset of these chronic pathologies, increase overall life expectancy, and improve the quality of life of patients of all ages (see item 248).

In children, daily physical activity is necessary for the development and improvement of motor and physical skills. Practising sport has beneficial effects on mental health (increased self-esteem, reduced anxiety) and physical health (prevention of obesity, metabolic syndrome). Moreover, an individual who takes part in sporting activities as a child is more likely to do so as an adult. Physical activity in childhood therefore partly determines the health of future adults. Involving children in competitions allows them to develop their social interactions and to test themselves against others, serving as a vehicle for motivation and progress.

At any age, the risks of practising sport include:

- Mainly cardiovascular: While regular physical activity has been shown to be effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular risk is transiently increased during intense physical exercise (increased cardiac output and arterial pressure during exercise), compared with the situation at rest. This is why the main contraindications to practising sport are cardiovascular, and why the medical examination for the absence of contraindications to practising sport focuses on the cardiovascular system.

- Traumatic, depending on the type of sporting activity.",1.0,9.740000000000002,False,True,0.7348157167434692,0.6368292570114136,c,False,4,3

## Definitions

Atelectasis is a collapse of the lung parenchyma, affecting a segment, a lobe, or the entire lung.

Atelectasis is most often of bronchial origin, secondary to endo-luminal, mural, or extrinsic obstruction of a bronchus, usually of large diameter. It can also be passive (pulmonary collapse due to pleural effusion or ascension of the diaphragmatic dome) or due to coiling (secondary to pleural thickening).

Atelectasis of bronchial origin is manifested on chest X-ray by direct and indirect signs.

### Direct Sign

- Opacity corresponding to a retracted lung, with a reduction in volume of the affected area. This opacity is systematized with sharp edges. In lobar atelectasis, the shape of the opacity varies according to the lobe affected, but is most often triangular with a hilar apex.
- No aeriform bronchogram.

### Indirect Signs

- Scissural displacement, becoming concave towards the healthy parenchyma.
- Attraction of adjacent anatomical structures such as the trachea, heart, and hilum.
- Ascension of the homolateral diaphragmatic dome.
- Possible compensatory hyperinflation of adjacent territories.

Chest X-rays are frequently used to detect atelectasis of bronchial origin. A profile X-ray, in addition to a frontal X-ray, is often used to confirm and localize atelectasis. A thoracic CT scan is indicated to specify the site of the obstruction (endoluminal, wall, or extrinsic) and its nature (foreign body, tumor, etc.).

### Example of Parenchymal Atelectasis on Chest X-ray

1. **Figure 1**: Diffuse homogeneous opacity of the left lung field, without aeriform bronchogram, associated with left tracheal deviation and ascension of the left diaphragmatic dome on chest radiograph. Mediastinal deviation secondary to atelectasis of the left lung, with evidence of an endoluminal lesion of the left main bronchus on chest CT with contrast injection. Primary bronchial tumor.

2. **Figure 2**: Homogeneous systematized retrocardiac opacity of the left lower lobe on chest radiograph, roughly triangular in shape with hilar apex. Left deviation of the cardiac silhouette. Corresponding paravertebral opacity showing complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe.

3. **Figure 3**: Systematized homogeneous opacity of the right upper lobe with displacement of the small scissure, ascending. The scissure has a concave edge towards the healthy lung in its lateral portion and a more convex edge above the right lobe. This is atelectasis of the right upper lobe, secondary to the presence of a suprahelical mass. The suprahilar mass is responsible for the convex medial contour of the atelectasis. Illustration on the same radiograph of both the concave and convex appearance of the scissure, a consequence of the presence of a tumor mass: this is Golden's ""S"" sign.

The clinical manifestations of hyperkalaemia result from changes in the potassium gradient between the intra- and extracellular compartments, which are responsible for alterations in membrane potentials. The cardiac effect is linked to myocardial hypoexcitability.

They are non-specific:

- Abnormalities of superficial sensitivity (pallesthetic and/or thermoalgesic) such as burning or paresthesia of the extremities.
- Later on, muscular weakness or even flaccid paralysis may appear, starting in the lower limbs and progressing upwards to the cervical muscles, with the inability to hold the head upright. In severe forms, this paralysis can affect the respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory failure.
- In practice, the appearance of hyperkalaemic flaccid paralysis is always accompanied by ECG abnormalities and heralds imminent cardiac arrest.

**2. Haemodynamic Signs**

- In severe forms: hyperkalaemia affects cardiac contractility, resulting in arterial hypotension. The fall in blood pressure in hyperkalaemia is a sign of seriousness.
- These clinical abnormalities justify the immediate performance of an electrocardiogram whenever hyperkalaemia is suspected, even before the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring blood kalaemia. There is no strict parallel between the level of hyperkalaemia and the severity of the electrocardiographic symptoms; however, the absence of any electrical abnormality for a kalaemia of more than 6 mmol/L should prompt a search for false hyperkalaemia.",1.0,13.372727272727271,False,True,0.7926875352859497,0.6109387278556824,b,False,2,3

Trisomy 21, or Down's syndrome, is suspected clinically and confirmed chromosomally.

The test to be prescribed is a constitutional karyotype on lymphocytes: a 2 ml peripheral venous blood sample in a heparinised tube.

Parents/patients need to be informed and asked to sign a consent form with a certificate of genetic counselling.

Information must be provided on:

- The objective (purpose) of the test: diagnosis of trisomy 21.
- The nature of the test: karyotype.
- The limitations of the test: no detection of abnormalities of less than 5 megabases (Mb), weak mosaics, nucleotide variants, risk of culture failure, etc.
- The delivery time: 4-5 days in the case of trisomy 21.
- The need to inform relatives if a serious condition justifying preventive measures, including genetic counselling or care, is identified.

A Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) study can be requested for a preliminary result within 24-48 hours.

To carry out genetic counselling, it is necessary to have the results of the karyotype to understand the mechanism causing trisomy 21.

Karyotyping can identify three types of results:

- Complete and homogeneous free trisomy 21: 95% of cases
  - Free: 3 separate 21 chromosomes
  - Complete: the whole of chromosome 21
  - Homogenous: in all cells

- Complete mosaic free trisomy 21: 2-3% of cases
  - Mosaic: two cell populations, cells with three 21 chromosomes and cells with two 21 chromosomes

- Complete trisomy 21 by Robertsonian translocation: 2-3% of cases
  - Robertsonian translocation: fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes. The most common example is a fusion between chromosome 14 and 21.

Note: Partial trisomy 21 can be identified by an unbalanced translocation involving part of chromosome 21 and part of another chromosome.

For a person with trisomy 21, there is no phenotypic difference depending on the chromosomal anomaly, except in the case of weak mosaics (less than 50%) and partial trisomy 21.",1.0,13.860000000000003,False,True,0.7496716380119324,0.8786351283391317,d,False,4,4

**Bodily Experience**

Bodily experience is the immediate and intimate awareness we have of our own bodies. Our bodies can be seen or touched by others, but only we can experience them from the inside. We therefore have a different perception of our own body and the bodies of others. This difference is exacerbated in the case of patients, who experience the unique nature of an illness in their own bodies, and can be a source of dissension between carers and patients. Carers, being healthy, tend to see illness as a physical phenomenon requiring medical intervention, whereas for patients, the experience of illness has an impact on their whole life. The patient's experience of illness triggers a search for meaning and gives rise to feelings (shame, fear) or behaviors (blame) that considerably increase their suffering.

By analyzing the experience of pain, we can understand how illness alters our experience of the body.

**Pain and Identity**

Pain is not just a physiological fact; it is first and foremost a fact of existence. It is not the body that suffers, but the whole individual, in terms of the meaning and value of his or her life. Pain thus affects the sense of identity. People no longer recognize themselves for who they were. The people around them change their behavior towards them.

The SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP equations are used for cardiovascular risk assessment. These equations are based on serum non-HDL cholesterol concentration, smoking habits, systolic blood pressure, age, and sex. They assess the 10-year risk of coronary ischaemia or stroke, both fatal and non-fatal. SCORE2 is valid for individuals aged 40 to 69 years, while SCORE2-OP is for those aged 70 years and older. These equations are not applicable for individuals with diabetes, chronic renal failure, familial hypercholesterolaemia, or known atheromatous pathology.

### Cardiovascular Risk Assessment Using Multifactorial Equations

- **Low to Moderate Risk**  
  - < 50 years: <2.5%  
  - 50-69 years: <5%  
  - ‚â• 70 years: <7.5%

- **High Risk**  
  - < 50 years: ‚â•2.5 to <7.5%  
  - 50-69 years: ‚â•5 to <10%  
  - ‚â• 70 years: ‚â•7.5 to <15%

- **Very High Risk**  
  - < 50 years: ‚â•7.5%  
  - 50-69 years: ‚â•10%  
  - ‚â• 70 years: ‚â•15%

If the SCORE2 or SCORE2-OP equations are not used, risk can be assessed by summing traditional risk factors (SFE-SFD-NSFA consensus, 2016):

- **Age**: ‚â• 50 years in men, ‚â• 60 years in women
- **Family History**: Ischaemic cardiovascular disease ‚â§ 55 years in father or first-degree relative, ‚â§ 60 years in mother or first-degree relative
- **Smoking**: Current or stopped less than 3 years ago
- **Arterial Hypertension**
- **HDLc**: ‚â§ 1.0 mmol/L [‚â§0.4 g/L]

**Risk Levels:**

- Low: 0 or 1 cardiovascular risk factor
- Moderate: 2 cardiovascular risk factors
- High: ‚â• 3 cardiovascular risk factors
- Very High: History of cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention)

### Special Situations

**Diagnosis:**

- In over 85% of cases, there is a nephrotic syndrome, often impure.
- Diagnosis is based on renal biopsy:
  - Light microscopy:
    - Absence of proliferation
    - Normal or thickened and spiculated MBG on the outer surface
  - Immunofluorescence: Granular extramembranous deposits of IgG and C3
- GEMs often present with extramembranous deposits of IgG targeting an autoantigen expressed by podocytes, primarily the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2-R). These anti-PLA2-R IgGs (autoantibodies) are detected in the serum.
- GEM is sometimes diagnosed without a renal biopsy when there is a combination of nephrotic syndrome and anti-PLA2R serum antibodies.

- GEM can be:
  - Primary (85% of cases)
  - Secondary (15% of cases)

== Definitions ==  
In 2018, in France, one in four to six couples consult a doctor for infertility after one year, i.e., almost a quarter of the population wanting a child, reflecting a real public health problem.

The factors influencing fertility are:

=== In Women ===  
- Age: This is the main factor predicting fertility in women. The chances of pregnancy and live births decrease with age. This age-related reduction in fertility is due to a decrease in the quantity of follicles in the ovaries and a decline in oocyte quality.

- Overweight and especially obesity

- Consumption of tobacco

=== In Men ===  
- Age, but to a lesser degree than in women.

- Numerous lifestyle and environmental factors, such as smoking, cannabis use, exposure to pollution or heat, physical activity, and stress.

- Weight is an important factor, as there is evidence of a dose-response relationship between male Body Mass Index and male hypofertility.

=== In Couples ===  
- Frequency of sexual intercourse

== Fertility ==  
The total fertility rate in France in 2019 was 1.87 children per woman.

The fertility rate is influenced by social and behavioral factors such as birth policies, the age at first pregnancy, couples' choices, and the use of contraception.

**Multidisciplinary Consultation Meetings (RCP)** are collegial meetings attended by at least three doctors from different specialties to reach a decision on the best way to treat a patient, based on the state of the art at the time. RCPs are used to validate the continuing professional development (CPD) obligation.

They are systematically organized in the field of oncology to define the diagnostic, therapeutic, and follow-up strategy for cancer patients. They can be organized in other fields whenever the patient's care is complex and requires a concerted and collegial opinion, guaranteeing the best strategy for the patient.

**Description:** Knowing the mechanisms of action.

**Rubric:** Management.

==Hypolipidemics: Understanding the Mechanisms of Action, Indications, Side Effects, Drug Interactions, Monitoring Procedures, and Main Causes of Failure==

Cholesterol-lowering drugs include Statins (Simvastatin, Pravastatin, Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin), Ion exchange resins (Cholestyramine), Ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors (Evolocumab, Alirocumab).

Hypotriglyceridemics include Fibrates (fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, gemfibrozil) and Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oils).

==Mechanisms of Action==

===Cholesterol-lowering Agents===

- **Statins:** These HMG CoA reductase inhibitors reduce hepatic cholesterol synthesis and increase the turnover of hepatic LDL receptors, stimulating the activity of LDL receptors and thus the capture of LDL by hepatocytes.
- **Cholestyramine:** A bile salt chelator that prevents the reabsorption of bile acids, reduces the absorption of dietary cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, and increases the expression of hepatic LDL receptors, leading to increased uptake of LDL lipoproteins by hepatocytes.
- **Ezetimibe:** Reduces the absorption of enterocyte cholesterol and increases the expression of hepatic LDL receptors.
- **PCSK9 inhibitors:** Promote renewal of hepatic LDL receptors.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

- **Fibrates:** PPAR alpha receptor agonists that reduce hepatic VLDL synthesis, increase lipolysis, triglyceride catabolism, HDL production, and their return to the liver.
- **Omega 3 fatty acids:** Reduce hepatic VLDL synthesis and increase triglyceride catabolism.

==Indications==

The prescription of a hypolipidemic drug is always preceded by 3 to 6 months (primary prevention) or associated (secondary prevention) with a phase of hygiene and dietary measures.

===Cholesterol-lowering Drugs===

- **Statins:** Isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, mixed hyperlipidemia alone or in combination.
- **Resin:** Isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, alone or in combination.
- **Ezetimibe:** Isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, alone or in combination.
- **PCSK9 inhibitor:** Severe hypercholesterolemia, secondary prevention if LDL-C > 0.70 g/L under maximum tolerated lipid-lowering treatment.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

- **Fibrates:** Alone in the case of isolated hypertriglyceridemia, possibly combined with a statin in the case of mixed hyperlipidemia.
- **Omega-3 fatty acids:** In combination with a fibrate if ineffective.

==Undesirable Effects==

===Cholesterol-lowering Drugs===

- **Statins:** Myalgias, rare rhabdomyolysis, increased transaminases, rare drug-induced hepatitis, increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
- **Resin:** Constipation, nausea, epigastralgia, reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
- **Ezetimibe:** Myalgias, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence.
- **PCSK9 inhibitor:** Rare pain, hemorrhage, hematoma at the injection site, upper respiratory symptoms, pruritus.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

- **Fibrates:** Myalgias, cramps, muscular fatigue, rare drug-induced hepatitis, increased biliary lithogenesis, skin allergy.
- **Omega 3 fatty acids:** Digestive effects.

==Drug Interactions==

===Cholesterol-lowering Drugs===

- **Statins:** Interaction with molecules metabolized by cytochrome CYP 3A4 and CYP2C9, increased risk of hemorrhage with VKAs, disruption of immunosuppressant pharmacokinetics.
- **Resin:** Reduced absorption of medicines if taken simultaneously.
- **Ezetimibe + Fibrates:** Potentiation of the risk of adverse effects and biliary lithiasis.
- **PCSK9 inhibitors:** None described.
- **Cholestyramine:** Decreased intestinal absorption of oral anticoagulants, digitalis, and fat-soluble vitamins.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

- **Fibrates:** Increases the duration of action of oral anticoagulants, risk of pharmacokinetic interference with many molecules.
- **Omega-3 fatty acids:** None.

==Monitoring Procedures==

For all lipid abnormalities, monitoring is conducted 4-8 weeks after treatment initiation, depending on the drug type.

===Cholesterol-lowering Drugs===

- **Statins:** Clinical monitoring for myalgias, biological monitoring for hepatic transaminases and CPK.
- **Resin:** Clinical monitoring for constipation.
- **Ezetimibe:** Clinical monitoring for digestive disorders.
- **PCSK9 inhibitor:** Clinical monitoring for local reactions at injection sites.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

- **Fibrates:** Biological monitoring for hepatic transaminases, CPK, creatininemia, and INR if treated with VKAs.
- **Omega 3 fatty acids:** Clinical monitoring for digestive problems.

==Main Causes of Failure==

Failure is an inappropriate term for lipid-lowering treatment; ineffectiveness or intolerance would be more appropriate. Poor compliance with treatment may be encouraged by poor tolerance (muscular with statins, ezetrol or fibrates; digestive with Cholestyramine and omega-3s).

Red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) has no marketing authorization for hypercholesterolemia but contains variable quantities of lovastatin.

**Description:** Cover test, corneal reflection, restitution movement, red lens examination

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis

**1. Inspection:** Study of corneal reflections: The corneal reflections of a light source directed onto the eyes of a normal subject are both projected onto the center of the pupil. In the case of deviation, one of the two reflections is not centered.

**2. Examination of ocular motility in different gaze positions:** This examination is used to observe the six oculomotor muscles of each eye separately (ductions) and in combination (versions).

**3. Cover-test:** This test consists of asking the subject to stare at a point situated straight ahead in the distance. One eye is masked by a cover and then the cover is moved to the opposite eye. In subjects with normal oculomotor parallelism, no movement is observed. In the case of paralytic strabismus, a restitution movement is observed.

**4. Red lens examination:** This examination consists of placing a red lens in front of one eye (conventionally in front of the right eye) while the subject stares, with the uncovered left eye, at a white spot of light in front of them. Normally, the two images are confused in all gaze positions, and the patient sees only one point of light. In the case of an oculomotor imbalance, the two points are separated: the patient sees a red point and a white point, and the shift can be analyzed to identify the muscle in deficit.

**5. Hess-Lancaster or Lancaster test:** This test is used to diagnose oculomotor paralysis, determine the side of the paralysis, and identify the paralyzed muscle or muscles. It also allows the evolution of the paralysis to be followed by successive readings. A different colored glass is placed in front of each of the patient's eyes, a red glass in one eye and a green glass in the other. The patient is asked to move a luminous arrow, seen in red, on a screen and superimpose it on a luminous arrow, seen in green, moved by the examiner. The result is a graphical record of oculomotricity in the different gaze positions.

**6. Investigation of intrinsic motricity:** Inspection should look for pupillary inequality (anisocoria). The photomotor reflex (PMR) or pupillary response to light involves illumination of one eye causing miosis of the illuminated eye (direct PLR) and simultaneous miosis of the contralateral eye (consensual PLR).",0.6363636363636364,13.718888888888891,False,True,0.7597833871841431,0.5918980638186137,c,False,2,3

**Multifactorial Management of T2DM**

Multifactorial management of T2DM involves considering all cardiovascular risk factors present in the patient. In addition to controlling blood sugar levels, therapeutic objectives include:

- Stopping smoking
- Controlling lipid levels and blood pressure
- Adhering to dietary rules
- Engaging in physical activity
- Taking medication

Therapeutic objectives (glycaemia, blood pressure, lipids) are tailored to the patient's clinical and biological profile.

Factors to consider when determining the glycaemic target (HbA1c) include:

- Duration of diabetes
- Life expectancy
- Existence of co-morbidities
- Risk of hypoglycaemia (SD-209) or other adverse drug reactions (SD-348)
- Patient's motivation

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Diagnosing a Gout Attack**

Gout attacks usually begin in the lower limb, particularly the foot (MTP joint of the big toe, ankle, then ascending to the knee). Attacks resolve themselves or are shortened or blocked by treatment. They recur in the absence of hypouricemic treatment with a variable frequency of weeks, months, or years. Attacks often occur closer together. At this stage of acute attacks, the joints are normal between attacks. After several years, they may affect the upper limbs. Gout rarely affects the spine, hip, or shoulder.

The diagnosis of gout is based on:

- **Background:** Men over 35, menopausal women, long-term treatment with diuretics, organ transplants; the family context must be investigated because gout has a strong genetic component (usually a polygenic disease, rare mutations in juvenile gout).
  
- **Nutritional Deviations:** Excessive consumption of sugary drinks rich in fructose (even ""sugar-free"" soft drinks), consumption of beer with or without alcohol (rich in guanine), strong alcohols (whisky, cognac, etc.), high-calorie diets, and diets rich in animal proteins.
  
- **History:** Previous gout attacks, family history of gout, history of uric lithiasis; in a gouty attack, triggers should be sought: trauma, postoperative context, infarction or distant infection, medication (initiation of a hypouricemic agent), intake of certain drinks or foods triggering gouty attacks in a given gout sufferer.
  
- **Characteristics of a Microcrystalline Crisis**
  
- **Topography**
  
- **Rapid Sensitivity to Colchicine:** When started early.
  
- **Presence of Visible and/or Clinically Palpable Tophus**

**Reasoned Request/Prescription and Choice of Diagnostic Test**

- **Uricemia:** Most often found to be above 360 Œºmol/l (60 mg/l), but may be normal during attacks. The measurement should be repeated a fortnight after the gouty attack to obtain a ""basal"" uricemia before the start of hypouricemic treatment.
  
- **Detection of UMS Microcrystals:** In the joint fluid or in a clinical tophus; this is the most important diagnostic test as it is pathognomonic.
  
- **Imaging Tests:**
  - **Joint Radiography:** Does not show the appearance of uratic arthropathy until very late, with epiphyseal geodes or notches, prolonged preservation of the joint space, and marginal osteophytosis. It is particularly useful for differential diagnosis.
  - **Joint Ultrasound with Colour Doppler:** Can be very useful if it shows a ""double contour"" appearance (corresponding to the uratic deposits present on the surface of the cartilage) or to detect gouty tophus not visible on clinical examination or X-ray. Doppler will show the more intense vascularisation associated with the vascular component of the local inflammatory reaction.

**Identify Situations Requiring Specialist Advice**

- Any early onset of gout before the age of 35 (on the advice of rheumatologists or specialist nephrologists: look for genetic or kidney diseases).
  
- Polyarticular gout.
  
- Tophaceous gout or gouty dactylitis.
  
- Gout in chronic renal failure (GFR < 60 ml/min).

# Diuretics

## Three Drug Classes

The image shows various types of diuretics.

- Loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide)
- Thiazide diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)
- Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., amiloride, spironolactone)

## Mechanisms of Action

### Loop Diuretics

- Natriuretic effect due to inhibition of the NKCC2 co-transporter (""Na-K-Cl cotransporter"") at the level of the large ascending branch of Henl√©.
- Associated effects: renal loss of calcium and magnesium, renal loss of potassium, and metabolic alkalosis.

### Thiazide Diuretics

- Natriuretic effect due to inhibition of the NCC transporter in the distal convoluted tubule.
- Associated effects: altered dilution capacity, renal potassium loss, reduced urinary calcium excretion.

### Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

Two mechanisms of action depending on the molecule:

- Inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel (eNaC) (amiloride)
- Aldosterone receptor antagonist (spironolactone)
- Associated effects: potassium sparing, metabolic acidosis

## Indications

### Loop Diuretics

- Edema of cardiac, renal (in particular nephrotic syndrome), or hepatic origin (usually in association with a potassium-sparing diuretic).
- Heart failure
- Arterial hypertension (SD-042) in patients with chronic renal failure when thiazide diuretics are contraindicated (particularly when creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min).

### Thiazide Diuretics

- High blood pressure
- Edema of cardiac, renal, or hepatic origin (usually in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic).

### Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

- eNaC inhibitor (amiloride): In association with thiazide or loop diuretics, to prevent potassium depletion; ascites and edema in cirrhotics.

### Aldosterone Receptor Antagonist

- Hyperaldosteronism secondary to diuretic treatment or edema.
- Essential arterial hypertension and resistant arterial hypertension (after use of a validated triple antihypertensive therapy at the right dose and hygiene and dietary measures).
- Stage III or IV heart failure, in association with a loop diuretic or a conversion enzyme inhibitor.
- Adjuvant therapy for myasthenia to reduce potassium requirements.

## Adverse Reactions

### Loop Diuretics and Thiazides

- Hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyponatraemia, hyperuricaemia, volume depletion.
- Glucose intolerance, increased triglycerides
- Immuno-allergic reaction
- Tinnitus, deafness (loop diuretics)
- Hypercalcaemia (thiazide diuretics), hypomagnesaemia (loop diuretics)

### Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

- Hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis
- Gynecomastia, impotence, menstrual irregularity, libido disorders (non-specific aldosterone receptor antagonists).
- Immuno-allergic reaction

## Drug Interactions

### With Loop and Thiazide Diuretics

- Drugs that prolong the QT interval (risk of torsade de pointes)
- Lithium: risk of increased lithaemia
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, blockers of the renin-angiotensin system: risk of acute renal failure.

### With Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

- Hyperkalaemic drugs (ciclosporin, tacrolimus, renin-angiotensin system blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, trimethoprim), particularly in diabetic patients and/or patients with heart failure, who are at greater risk of hyperkalaemia.
- Lithium: risk of increased lithaemia
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, renin-angiotensin system blockers: risk of acute renal failure.

## Contraindications

### Loop Diuretics

- Hypersensitivity
- Urinary tract obstruction, hypokalaemia, hypovolaemia
- Acute hepatitis, severe hepatocellular insufficiency (furosemide)
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding

### Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

- Hypersensitivity, hyperkalaemia, severe or acute renal failure, pregnancy, breastfeeding.

## Monitoring Procedures

- Clinical: weight, hydration status, blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, skin fold, etc.
- Biological: kalaemia, natraemia, creatininaemia, calcaemia in certain patients on thiazides, uric acid, etc.
- ECG if hypo- or hyperkalaemia

**Primary Prevention**

In France, the Veil law of 1976, the Evin law of 1991, and the Bertrand decree of 2006 have curbed the expansion of smoking.

- The main measures recommended are:
  - A ban on all direct and indirect advertising.
  - Repeated and dissuasive price increases for all tobacco products.
  - Protection against exposure to passive smoking in public places and workplaces.
  - Education and information, including health warnings in the form of images on packets.

The 2014-2019 National Tobacco Reduction Programme (PNRT) included three major measures:

1. Introduction of plain packaging.
2. Reimbursement of nicotine substitutes or varenicline by the French health insurance system.
3. Introduction of a ""No Smoking Month"" every November.

The 2018-2022 National Programme for Tobacco Control includes regional variations:

1. Protecting children and preventing them from taking up smoking.
2. Encouraging and supporting smokers to quit.
3. Acting on the tobacco economy to protect public health.
4. Monitoring, evaluating, researching, and disseminating knowledge about tobacco.

Its ambition is that, by 2032, children born since 2014 will become the first generation of non-smoking adults (<5% smokers).

**Secondary Prevention**

All healthcare professionals should be involved in smoking prevention from school age and in helping people to stop smoking.

The factors most predictive of smoking cessation are:

- Good socio-economic level.
- Low tobacco consumption.
- No one around them smokes.
- Low alcohol consumption.
- Late onset of intoxication.
- Short duration of intoxication.
- Long delay between awakening and first cigarette.

**Description:** Know how to identify the non-adapted nature of the renal response (notion of urinary anion gap)  
**Rubric:** Diagnostic Approach  

### Toxic Causes and Renal Tubular Acidosis

1. **Toxic Causes:**  
   Intoxication with an exogenous acid can lead to acidosis and blood pressure changes due to the accumulation of the exogenous acid. Examples include:  
   - Salicylate  
   - Ethylene glycol  
   - Methanol  

2. **Renal Tubular Acidosis:**  
   - The main form of renal elimination of excess protons (H‚Å∫) is the ammonium ion (NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫). In hyperchloremic acidosis, the renal response can be assessed by calculating the urinary anion gap (UAG), which inversely reflects ammoniuria. UAG = U<sub>Na</sub> + U<sub>K</sub> - U<sub>Cl</sub>.  
   - Physiologically, UAG is slightly positive.  
   - In hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis:  
     - If the UAG is < 0 (high urinary NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫ concentration = adapted renal response), the acidosis is of extrarenal origin (e.g., digestive loss of bicarbonate).  
     - If the UAG is > 0 (low urinary NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫ concentration = inadequate renal response), the acidosis is of renal tubular origin.

The infection transmission chain illustrates how infectious diseases spread.

The transmission of an infectious disease results from the interaction between:

- **An infectious agent**: Characterized by its pathogenicity (ability to cause disease), virulence (ability to develop and/or secrete toxins in an organism), inoculum (infectious load introduced into the organism: number of viable bacteria, viral particles, etc.), its resistance to anti-infectives, etc.
- **A reservoir**: The ecological location where the infectious agent usually lives and multiplies, which may include humans.
- **A vector**: Animate or inanimate carrier of the infectious agent.
- **A source**: Unusual place where the infectious agent multiplies (e.g., a hot water system for Legionella pneumophila).
- **A host**: An individual characterized by susceptibility (immunity, skin lesions, or other entry points) or risk behavior (risky sexual practices, injectable drug use, certain leisure activities such as hunting - tularemia, fishing - leptospirosis), leading to the development of an infection or colonization by the infectious agent.

For ""strict pathogens"" (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, hemorrhagic fever viruses), interaction with the host always leads to infection rather than simple colonization.

In other cases, the interaction between an infectious agent and a host may result in ""colonization"" that is tolerated by the host. This agent may be part of the host's usual flora (commensal flora) or not (opportunistic agent). The transition from colonization to infection results from a disruption in the balance between the infectious agent and the host due to an alteration in the host's local defenses (cutaneous invasion or mucosal alteration) or general immune defenses, such as opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients.

An infection is said to be endogenous when the reservoir is the microbiota (all commensal microorganisms hosted in the skin, mucous membranes, and digestive tract).

An infection is said to be exogenous when the reservoir of infectious agents is located outside the infected host. The reservoir can then be:

- **Human**: This is the most common situation. A person infected or colonized by an infectious agent (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria meningitidis) transmits it to other individuals.
- **Animal**: The infectious disease is then a zoonosis (e.g., non-typical salmonellosis, listeriosis).
- **Environmental**: The reservoir is soil (telluric germ, e.g., tetanus), air (e.g., aspergillosis), or water (aquatic germ, e.g., legionellosis).",0.5714285714285714,14.9875,False,True,0.7069923281669617,0.6075928409894308,d,False,5,3

**Title:** Knowing Medicated and Surgical Abortion Techniques  
**Description:** Methods and techniques for carrying out abortions

Two techniques can be used to perform an abortion: the medicinal technique and the instrumental technique.

During the medicated technique, metrorrhagia generally occurs within 3 to 4 hours of taking the prostaglandin, but this should not be taken as proof of success. Effectiveness is judged on the basis of complete expulsion without the need for surgery, and also on the rate of progressive pregnancy. Analgesic treatment must be associated.

The instrumental technique can be performed under local, loco-regional, or general anaesthetic.

**Medical Abortion vs. Instrumental Abortion**

- **Maximum Legal Period:**
  - Medical Abortion: Up to 9 weeks' gestation
  - Instrumental Abortion: Up to 16 weeks

- **Treatment Regimen:**
  - **Medical Abortion:**
    - Oral mifepristone followed by oral misoprostol 24 to 48 hours later.
    - Before 7 SA: 200 or 600 mg mifepristone, 400 microg misoprostol
    - Between 7 and 9 SA: 200 mg mifepristone, 800 microg misoprostol
  - **Instrumental Abortion:**
    - 200 mg mifepristone per os 48 hours before the procedure
    - Or 400 microg misoprostol per os 3 to 4 hours before the procedure
    - The procedure is carried out by aspiration with a cannula after dilating the cervix with a bougie adapted to the gestational age.

**Description:** To know the prevention methods and what to do in the event of exposure of a pregnant woman

**Rubric:** Management

**Discovery of a Pregnancy After a Radiodiagnostic Examination**

- If the uterus is outside the radiation beam (e.g., skull, thorax, limbs), the patient can be reassured.
- If the uterus is in the radiation beam (e.g., intravenous urography, hysterography, pelvic scanner):
  - For a ""standard"" examination (usual number of images and/or duration of scopy), the patient can be reassured. The dose delivered to the uterus is exceptionally greater than 100 mGy, below which the risks are very low (apart from the moderate risk of mutagenesis).
  - For an ""unusual"" examination (very high number of images and/or duration of scopy), seek the advice of a department responsible for calculating the dose-gonad (IRSN).

**Diagnostic X-ray Examination of a Pregnant Woman**

**Precautions for Radiographic Examination on Women of Childbearing Age**

- Pregnant women should not be exposed to ionizing radiation as a matter of principle.
- In radiology, ask any woman of childbearing age whether she is at risk of becoming pregnant at the time of the examination.
- If pregnant, try to replace the irradiating test with non-irradiating tests, such as ultrasound and/or MRI.
- Place a lead apron over the patient's abdomen to limit the dose delivered to the uterus during the examination.
- Limit the number of images taken/scopy time to what is strictly necessary.
- If a radiographic/scopic examination is necessary, do not contraindicate it solely on the grounds of pregnancy: there are often more benefits than risks in carrying it out (benefit/risk balance).
- If the uterus is outside the radiation beam, the planned radiodiagnostic examination can be carried out (do not forget the lead apron).
- If the uterus is in the radiation beam:
  - Prefer an examination without ionizing radiation if possible: MRI or ultrasound.
  - If the radiodiagnostic examination (with or without contrast medium) is necessary for proper management, it can generally be carried out with protective measures or measures to reduce irradiation, discussed on a case-by-case basis with a specialist department.

**Pregnant Woman Occasionally Standing Close to a Patient Undergoing Radiological Examination**

- In these circumstances, as the uterus is not in the radiation beam, irradiation is negligible.
- Pregnant women inadvertently exposed to such conditions should be reassured.
- A pregnant woman may occasionally stand next to a patient undergoing an X-ray examination, wearing a lead apron as a precaution.

**Various forms of pollution affect water resources:**

- **Thermal Pollution:** Linked to various human activities, it poses a health risk through the microbiological proliferation it causes, such as free amoebae, legionella, and algae.

- **Radioactive Pollution:** Generally low, except in cases of exceptional accidents.

- **Chemical Pollution:** Probably the most common form:
  - Sodium from mining waste or seawater infiltration.
  - Nitrates from agricultural activities, which are toxic if reduced to nitrites that bind to haemoglobin. They are precursors of nitrosamines and can be carcinogenic.
  - Phosphates from agricultural activities and urban waste contribute to the eutrophication process, leading to the development of algae that produce toxins.
  - Heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium) are deposited in river and coastal sediments. They can concentrate in aquatic flora and fauna, posing a poisoning risk to humans.
  - Dangers associated with mineral salt imbalances due to natural contamination or disruption caused by man-made additions.
  - Organic pollution linked to human activities, including detergents, solvents, hydrocarbons, and medicines.

- **Microbial and Parasitic Pollution:**
  - Originates from fecal, human, and animal sources linked to inadequate treatment of drinking water. The most well-known and frequent are responsible for gastrointestinal disorders.
  - **Bacteria:** Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae.
  - **Viruses:** Enterovirus, Coxsackie, Echovirus, Hepatitis A and E, Coronavirus, Rotavirus, Norovirus, etc., causing gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and neuromeningeal disorders.
  - **Parasites:** Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium spp.
  - In certain uses of water, microorganisms can become pathogenic, such as Legionella pneumophila and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (Mycobacterium xenopi).

There is no need to measure cortisol or ACTH to adjust the dose of hydrocortisone.

If necessary, the dose of fludrocortisone can be adjusted with the aid of a renin assay (high renin indicates underdose, low renin indicates overdose) and a blood ionogram.

In the long term, consider a bone, metabolic, and cardiovascular assessment in the event of hydrocortisone overdose.

**Title:** Know the definition and natural history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and how to search for other aneurysmal locations  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Definition  

== Aneurysm of the Abdominal Aorta ==

An arterial aneurysm is a focal and permanent dilatation of the artery with a loss of parallelism of its walls, and whose diameter is greater than 1.5 times the upstream diameter. The most common location is the abdominal aorta. The most common peripheral aneurysms are in the popliteal arteries. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) develop preferentially in the sub-renal segment. It may be confined exclusively to the sub-renal aorta or extend to the iliac arteries.

=== Epidemiology ===

The main risk factors are smoking, advanced age, male sex, and a family history of AAA. AAA is often associated with atheromatous lesions in other arterial territories (coronary arteries, carotid arteries, visceral arteries, arteries of the lower limbs). The prevalence of AAA is 5% in men aged over 65. The prevalence in women is not well known and is lower than in men.

=== Natural History ===

The diameter of the AAA increases over time. In the same patient, the rate of growth is not linear and there are variations from one patient to another. The greater the aortic diameter, the faster the rate of growth. An AAA is said to be ""fast-growing"" if it increases by more than 1 cm per year. The risk of AAA developing is rupture, and this risk increases with the diameter. It is low for a diameter of less than 40 mm, and high above 55 mm. For the same diameter, the risk of rupture is greater in women.

=== Other Aneurysmal Locations ===

- **Popliteal Artery Aneurysms**:  
  AAA can be associated with aneurysms in other locations, most often in the popliteal arteries. Aneurysms of the popliteal arteries almost exclusively affect men and are often bilateral (50% of cases). A popliteal artery aneurysm is either asymptomatic, discovered during the clinical examination (popliteal pulses too well perceived), or during ultrasound exploration (for example, during the assessment of an AAA). It may also be discovered in the setting of acute ischaemia, critical ischaemia, or, more rarely, stress ischaemia. The main risk is lower limb ischaemia (acute ischaemia or critical ischaemia), due to iterative low-noise emboli obstructing the downstream arterial network, or thrombosis of the aneurysm, the two mechanisms often being associated. The risk of lower-limb amputation following popliteal aneurysm thrombosis is high. Rarely, popliteal artery aneurysms cause local compression (veins, nerves). Venous compression may be responsible for popliteal and sub-popliteal venous thrombosis. Rupture is exceptional and should raise suspicion of an infectious origin.

- **Aneurysms of the Iliac or Femoral Arteries**:  
  More rarely, other locations associated with AAA involve the femoral, common iliac, or internal iliac arteries. They are systematically investigated by ultrasound or CT angiography.

- **Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms**:  
  AAA may be associated with a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT angiography is recommended to assess the extent of aneurysmal disease.",0.6,12.690000000000001,False,True,0.7932298183441162,0.7647420167922974,d,False,4,4

## Definitions

### Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (GNRP)

Definition: A group of glomerulonephritic diseases expressed by a GNRP syndrome.

- Rapidly progressive renal failure
- Proteinuria
- Haematuria

Seriousness: Diagnostic and therapeutic emergencies. Renal biopsy must be performed urgently. It shows extra-capillary proliferative glomerulonephritis with extra-capillary crescents and determines the type of GNRP, guiding the aetiological diagnosis.

### Classification and Causes of GNRP

**Type 1: Deposits of Anti-MBG Antibodies**  
- Linear IgG deposits on MBG  
  - Goodpasture's disease  
  - Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies (anti-MBG)  

**Type 2: Immune Deposits**  
- Non-linear, endomembrane and granular deposits of Ig and/or complement.  
  - Primary N-IgA and rheumatoid purpura  
  - Cryoglobulinemia  
  - Systemic lupus  
  - Glomerulonephritis caused by bacterial infections  
  - Cryoglobulin, NAA, anti-DNA, C3, C4 decrease except for NIgA  

**Type 3: ""Pauci-immune"" GN (Absence of Deposits)**  
- No Ig deposits  
  - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis  
  - Microscopic polyangiitis  
  - ANCA anti-MPO or anti-PR3  

ANCA: Anti-polynuclear cytoplasm antibodies; AAN: Anti-nuclear antibodies; MPO: Myeloperoxidase; PR3: Proteinase 3

### GNRP Type 1 or GNRP with Linear IgG Deposits: Goodpasture's Disease

- Due to the presence of a pathogenic circulating anti-MBG autoantibody fixed linearly along the MBG and the pulmonary alveolar membrane.
- More common in young men, smokers, and elderly subjects.
- Often revealing pulmonary signs: cough, dyspnoea, respiratory distress, inconstant haemoptysis, and bilateral infiltrates indicating alveolar haemorrhage (siderophages on BAL).
- Renal manifestations: GNRP syndrome with severe renal failure, often oligo-anuric.
- Diagnosis is based on detection of circulating anti-MBG antibodies and renal biopsy, which reveals GN with epithelial crescents and linear IgG deposits along the MBG.
- Treatment is symptomatic (fluid and electrolyte disorders, ARF, respiratory failure, anaemia) and specific (high-dose corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and cyclophosphamide).
- This is a genuine diagnostic and therapeutic emergency, with life-threatening pulmonary failure and a high risk of permanent renal failure.

### GNRP Type 2 or GNRP with Immune Complex Deposits

Multiple causes based on glomerular deposits of immunoglobulins and complement on renal biopsy.

### GNRP Type 3 or Pauci-immune GNRP

- Absence of immunoglobulin deposits in the glomeruli.
- They are the renal involvement (sometimes isolated) of ANCA-associated vasculitides, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and microscopic polyangiitis.

#### Clinical and Laboratory Signs of Pauci-immune GN

**Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**  
- General signs: Fever, weight loss, arthralgias, myalgias, hyperleukocytosis, elevated CRP
- Signs of vasculitis (inconstant): Vascular purpura, livedo, cough, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, pulmonary infiltrates (intra-alveolar haemorrhage), abdominal pain with bloody diarrhoea, episcleritis, single or multiple neuritis
- Specific extrarenal signs: Crusty rhinitis, epistaxis, nasal and pharyngeal ulcerations, sinusitis, otitis, lung nodules, retro-orbital tumour
- Renal signs: GNRP (rapidly progressive renal failure, proteinuria, haematuria)
- Renal history: GN with extracapillary proliferation, necrosis of the glomerular capillary wall, absence of immunoglobulin deposition in IF
- ANCA: + in 90% of cases, c-ANCA type, anti-proteinase 3 (PR3)

**Microscopic Polyangiitis**  
- General signs: Same as above
- ANCA: + in 80% of cases, p-ANCA type, anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO)",0.5,21.585555555555555,False,True,0.8661975860595703,0.8545835812886556,c,False,1,4

**Rubric:** Management

**Adult**

- Oral: Intake of water, glucose, and electrolytes, along with an anti-diarrhoea diet (cooked fruit, cooked vegetables with little fibre, prefer pasta, rice, white bread, potatoes, and bananas; avoid dairy products).

- If signs of seriousness, dehydration > 8% of body weight, or significant vomiting: Infusion adapted to kalaemia; supply 50% of volume loss over the first 6 hours, then 50% over the remaining 18 hours.

- Symptomatic treatment of diarrhoea: Antisecretory agents (racecadotril, acetorphan) possible; loperamide contraindicated if dysenteric syndrome.

**Child's Home**

The main risk of acute diarrhoea in children is dehydration (see ""Acute diarrhoea and dehydration in infants, children and adults"" for more details). It is important to prevent both dehydration and malnutrition.

**Prevention/Treatment of Dehydration**

- Rehydration should be oral whenever possible (weight loss < 10% of body weight and no sign of hypovolaemia) with an oral rehydration solution (ORS), administered in fractions if vomiting occurs.

- In the event of failure of oral rehydration with ORS or initial signs of severity (weight loss > 10%, hypovolaemia): Inpatient intravenous rehydration (after vascular filling in the event of hypovolaemia - physiological serum NaCl 9‚Ä∞ 20ml/kg) with isotonic polyionic glucose solution at least 4g/L of NaCl. Beware of correcting hypernatraemia too quickly and the risk of cerebral oedema, so monitoring natraemia is important. The flow rate is 150ml/kg/d in infants, 100 to 120ml/kg/d thereafter, to be adapted to losses and progress (weight, diuresis), then ORS relay according to progress after at least 6 hours.

- If the oral route fails and the approach is difficult:
  - Signs of hypovolaemia: The intraosseous line should be filled and then infused.
  - No haemodynamic problems: Trial of enteral ORS via a nasogastric tube (200ml/kg/d to be adapted).

**Prevention of Undernutrition**

- Do not stop feeding: Alternate feedings and ORS if breast-feeding, resume milk-based feeding (other than breast milk) within 4 to 6 hours of starting ORS rehydration with previous milk (lactose-free only if severe and/or persistent), continue previous diversified diet (no diet).

**Symptomatic Treatment**

- They are only moderately effective and should not be prescribed at the expense of ORS, i.e., as a second-line treatment, after ORS.

- Marketing authorisation for children: Diosmectite and racecadotril.

- Not recommended: Anti-emetics.

- Contraindication: Loperamide (occlusive syndrome).",0.75,13.945882352941176,False,True,0.8179636001586914,0.6589380502700806,b,False,5,4

**Definitions**

Interstitial lung disease indicates damage to the interstitium, i.e., the supporting tissue of the lung (collagen skeleton). There are many types of diffuse interstitial lung disease (DIL), both acute and chronic, and often the involvement is not limited to the interstitial sector but may also extend to the alveolar or vascular sectors. Radiologically, Diffuse Interstitial Diseases have the following features in common:

- Usually diffuse, bilateral involvement
- A risk of progression to a fibrosing form with a poor prognosis

**Radiography**

Chest X-rays are routinely taken but do not always enable a precise diagnosis. They may also appear normal. Opacities are generally bilateral, diffuse, non-symmetrical, reticular, and/or micronodular. Lung volume may be reduced when fibrosis is present.

**Tomodensitometry**

A thoracic CT scan is essential for a precise analysis of the symptomatology, integrating it into the clinical-biological context and suggesting diagnostic ranges. It is used to characterize elementary lesions and assess their distribution (or predominance) along the apico-basal and hilo-pleural axes.

The main elementary lesions are listed below. They may be accompanied by signs of architectural distortion (fibrosis) such as traction bronchiectasis, pleural abnormalities, or mediastinal adenopathies.

- Septal lines (thickening of the interlobular septa), which can be seen in many pathologies: cardiogenic edema, carcinomatous lymphangitis, fibrosis, overload diseases, etc.
- Intralobular reticulations (intersecting fine irregular lines) generally seen in most pulmonary fibroses.
- Honeycomb (small cystic subpleural images attached to each other) representing irreversible fibrous destruction of the lung, present in particular in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis where it correlates with the histopathological appearance known as common interstitial pneumonia (CIP).
- Peri-lymphatic micronodules (clear, attached to the perilobular septa and pleural layers) seen particularly in sarcoidosis and carcinomatous lymphangitis.
- Centrilobular micronodules (blurred and sparing the subpleural regions) seen in diseases of the small airways: bronchiolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, etc.
- Frosted glass and condensations (hyperdensities of the parenchyma with or without obliteration of the vascular structures), which often indicate alveolar filling.
- Mosaic perfusion (lobules of varying density), which indicates obliterative damage to the small airways.
- Cysts (round images with aerated content and a wall) seen in certain rare diseases such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis or Langerhansian histiocytosis.

Sant√© Publique France (SPF) is a public body under the authority of the French government responsible for organizing health monitoring in France. Its four health monitoring missions are:

**1. Ongoing Monitoring and Observation of the State of Health of the French Population**

- Collecting and processing data on health status for epidemiological purposes via correspondents in the national public health network (RNSP).
- Examples include monitoring the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in certain bacterial species (e.g., Escherichia coli and Œ≤-lactams, enterococci and glycopeptides), the incidence of notifiable diseases (e.g., invasive meningococcal infections, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis), and vaccination coverage in the population.

**2. Health Watch and Vigilance**

- Analyzing and updating knowledge of health risks, their causes, and trends.
- Detecting risk factors likely to modify or alter the health of the population.

**3. Health Warning**

- Informing the Minister for Health of any threat to public health.
- Making recommendations to prevent or mitigate the threat.

**4. Contributing to the Management of Health Crisis Situations**

- For example, in the event of an alert linked to an emerging virus (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), SPF is responsible for validating the criteria defining a suspect case when a patient presents as a possible case.

Its fields of action cover communicable infectious diseases, the effects of the environment on health, work-related risks, chronic diseases and trauma, as well as international health risks, whether infectious or not.

There are many causes of Peripheral Facial Paralysis (PFP).

**1) Facial Paralysis a Frigore:**

- By far the most common cause of all facial paralysis.
- Likely due to compression of the nerve in its intrapetrous portion, related to an inflammatory or viral process.
- The arguments in favor of the diagnosis are detailed in the following objective.

**2) Other Causes:**

- **Head Trauma:** Immediate facial paralysis (compression or embrochage of the nerve) or delayed facial paralysis (post-traumatic edema).
- **Diabetes:** PFP can reveal diabetes, although more rarely than damage to one of the oculomotor nerves (VI, III).

**Infectious Causes:**

- **Herpes Zoster of the Geniculate Ganglion:** Vesicular eruption in the Ramsay-Hunt area. Severe and painful PFP with hearing impairment.
- **ENT Pathology:** Conditions like mastoiditis, parotitis, or parotid tumor may present with auricular discharge or painful enlargement of the parotid gland.
- **Lyme Meningo-radiculitis:** Tick bite in preceding days or weeks or erythematous plaque. PFP may reveal the infection.
- **Other Bacterial or Viral Meningoradiculitis:** Includes infections like coxsackie, herpes, and mumps.
- **HIV Infection:** Particularly during seroconversion.

- **Brain Stem Stroke:** PFP associated with contralateral hemiplegia of the face (alternating syndrome).
- **Multiple Sclerosis:** Importance of a history of previous relapses.
- **Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome:** PFP in the background of a picture dominated by limb involvement. Facial diplegia may occur.

**General Inflammatory Diseases:**

- **Sarcoidosis:** PFP may inaugurate the disease (most frequent cranial involvement).
- **Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome:** Recurrent PFP, with mucocutaneous infiltration of the face, plicated tongue, and family history.

**Tumors:**

- Progressive onset, usually affecting other cranial nerves (cerebellopontine angle tumor, trunk glioma, skull base metastasis, carcinomatous meningoradiculitis).

Other principles may include respect for human dignity, respect for integrity, and the notion of vulnerability.

Arbitrating between different principles when they conflict is at the heart of ethical reflection.

To illustrate some of the ethical issues involved in genetic counselling, consider the case of screening for trisomy 21. The trisomy 21 screening policy proposed in France has led some to view it as a eugenic policy. However, this screening is proposed rather than imposed, and at each stage of the process, the patient is given information so that she can decide not to continue with the screening procedure. Once the diagnosis has been made, she can choose to welcome a child with trisomy 21. The principle of patient autonomy is therefore preserved. In France, for various reasons ranging from material difficulties encountered by families (such as identification or accessibility of support adapted to the needs of the child and then the adult with trisomy 21) to societal pressure, around 90% of couples choose to request a medical termination of pregnancy.",1.0,18.913103448275866,False,True,0.7676389217376709,0.595089872678121,c,False,5,3

The most frequent cause is the interruption of prolonged corticosteroid therapy (Prescribe systemic or local corticosteroids SD-251):

- During oral corticosteroid therapy, the pituitary-adrenal axis is constantly slowed down.
- The adrenocortical axis does not recover immediately on discontinuation of a dose > 7 mg prednisone equivalent for 3 to 4 weeks.

There are two main conditions to be aware of, and their consequences:

- **Cell Death**, which can occur from a threshold of 100-200 mGy:
  - In the central nervous system, neurons are sensitive from the threshold of 100-200 mGy (no repercussions below 100 mGy), with a dose-effect relationship from 500 mGy. The main consequences of severe irradiation, such as Hiroshima or high direct abdominal irradiation, come from their death: reduced IQ, microcephaly, cataracts, IUGR. The period of greatest sensitivity is between 10 and 27 weeks' gestation:
    - Between 10 and 17 weeks' gestation (neuronal multiplication): severe reduction in IQ: -30 points, risk of 40% of profound mental retardation from 1000 mGy.
    - Between 18 and 27 weeks' gestation (neuronal migration): smaller reduction in IQ.
  - The other organs are better preserved. At very high doses, however, severe irradiation causes IUGR; in extreme cases, death in utero.

- **DNA Damage**, which can lead to a 40% increase in the risk of leukemia or cancer (i.e., √ó 1.4), with no really known threshold effect and a dose-response relationship (the risk starts with low levels of radiation and rises with the dose). Insofar as the risk of leukemia/cancer in children is spontaneously between 0.2 and 0.3%, fetal irradiation raises this gross risk to 0.3 to 0.4%, which remains low for a given individual.",0.8571428571428571,10.562500000000004,False,True,0.8340939283370972,0.5562158028284708,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Knowing the Definition of Criminal Liability

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Definition

**Definitions**

The purpose of criminal liability is to punish individuals whose behavior is deemed reprehensible by society. It is always personal and applies equally to all doctors (including interns), regardless of the context in which they practice. It may also apply to health establishments in their capacity as legal entities.

Behavior that society defines as reprehensible is called an offence. These are listed in the French Penal Code and classified into three categories in order of seriousness: contraventions, d√©lits, and crimes.

**Infractions**

Apart from certain specific provisions relating to non-compliance with conditions specific to certain healthcare activities (medically assisted procreation, biomedical research activities, etc.), the offences for which a doctor may be held responsible may also be committed by any citizen. However, doctors are more likely to commit certain offences than others. There are three main types of offences arising from the practice of medical care: those resulting from the breach of a duty of humanity, unintentional injury and manslaughter, and intentional injury and manslaughter.

**Violation of a Duty of Humanism**

The violation of a duty of humanism mainly concerns:
1. The drafting of false certificates (Article 441-7 of the French Penal Code).
2. The violation of professional secrecy (Article 226-13 of the French Penal Code).
3. Failure to assist a person in danger (Article 226-3 of the French Penal Code).

It should be noted that failure to inform the patient does not constitute a criminal offence. It is, however, a potential cause of civil liability.

**Manslaughter and Unintentional Injury**

Manslaughter and unintentional injury cover the majority of offences for which a doctor is liable (Articles 221-6, 222-19, and 222-20 of the French Penal Code). A patient's death or injury is presumed to be the result of a fault involving clumsiness, carelessness, inattention, negligence, or failure to comply with a safety obligation. The doctor in question may have failed to comply with the best available scientific evidence or may have committed a ""trivial"" error in making a diagnosis, prescribing a treatment, or carrying it out. For the offence to exist, the damage and the certain causal link with the fault must be established. The causal link can be either direct or indirect, provided that the fault committed is qualified, i.e., having created or contributed to creating the situation that contributed to the damage, or having failed to take the necessary measures to avoid it. There are two types of qualified fault:

- **Deliberate Fault**: This is a breach of a specific duty of care or safety imposed by law or regulation. It requires a deliberate (i.e., conscious) breach of a rule of caution or safety.
- **Serious Misconduct**: This is recklessness, negligence, or a breach of a duty of care or safety that exposes the patient to a particularly serious risk, of which the doctor cannot be unaware.

**Homicide and Wilful Bodily Harm**

These are still rare offences in the field of medical liability. They essentially boil down to the question of:

- Euthanasia.
- Failure to obtain a patient's consent to a medical act.
- Failure to comply with the conditions governing the lawfulness of certain medical procedures, which are governed by specific laws: termination of pregnancy, sterilization for contraceptive purposes, removal of organs, human experimentation, etc.

**Implementation of Criminal Liability**

**Lawsuits**

Prosecutions are initiated by the public prosecutor, who decides what action to take on complaints, reports, and police investigations. They may dismiss the case, refer the perpetrator directly to trial, or request that a judicial investigation be opened.

If the case is not dismissed, the judicial investigation stage is the rule in medical matters, given the frequent complexity of the cases.

**Judgment**

Minor offences are tried by the police court and punishable by fines, misdemeanours by the criminal court and punishable by imprisonment, and felonies by the assize court and punishable by criminal imprisonment.

The offences of which doctors are accused are usually dealt with by the criminal courts and are essentially offences punishable by imprisonment, which may be suspended, and fines.

At the same time as the criminal penalty is imposed, the patient who is the victim of the crime can claim compensation for the damage he has suffered, in the course of the same proceedings, by bringing a civil action.",0.8571428571428571,14.630000000000003,False,True,0.7769747972488403,0.6256798505783081,b,False,3,4

An initial clinical examination of the newborn is carried out in the delivery room. A second complete and detailed clinical examination must be conducted during the stay in the maternity unit, compulsorily before the 8th day of life. The examination is recorded in the health record, and the pediatrician draws up the first health certificate (certificate of the 8th day). The examination takes place in the presence of at least one of the two parents, in suitable conditions (well-lit room, suitable temperature, away from food, compliance with hygiene rules).

**Description:** Explain the principles governing the evaluation and reimbursement of medicinal products and therapeutic innovations (ANSM, HAS, CEPS).  
**Rubric:** Definition  

The medical service rendered (SMR) and the improved medical service rendered (ASMR) address the following questions:

- Does the drug have sufficient clinical interest to be covered by national health insurance?
- Does the drug offer progress compared with available treatments?

The SMR and ASMR are assessed by the Commission de la Transparence (CT) of the Haute Autorit√© de sant√© (HAS) after the drug has obtained its marketing authorization (AMM).

**Medical Service Rendered (SMR)**  
The SMR provides scientific and clinical evidence to the Union nationale des caisses d'assurance maladie (UNCAM) and the Minister to justify whether or not drugs should be reimbursed by national solidarity.

The SMR is determined based on characteristics relating to the indication and the medicinal product:

- The efficacy and adverse effects of the medicinal product
- The preventive, curative, or symptomatic nature of the medicinal product
- Its place in the therapeutic strategy, in relation to other available therapies
- Its public health value: severity of the disease, prevalence, medical need and response, impact on quality of life, impact in terms of morbidity and mortality, and impact on the organization of care

Based on the assessment of these criteria, four SMR levels have been defined, which determine access to reimbursement and the rate of reimbursement:

- **Important:** 65% reimbursement rate
- **Moderate:** 30% reimbursement rate
- **Low:** 15% reimbursement rate
- **Inadequate:** Not reimbursed

**Medical Service Improvement (ASMR)**  
The ASMR corresponds to the therapeutic progress made by a drug in a given disease. It depends on the other reference treatments available.

Based on this assessment, five levels of ASMR have been defined to help determine the price of the drug:

- **Major (ASMR I):** Possibility of a price higher than that of comparators
- **Important (ASMR II):** Possibility of a price higher than that of comparators
- **Moderate (ASMR III):** Possibility of a price higher than that of comparators
- **Minor (ASMR IV):** Possibility of a price higher than that of comparators
- **Absent (ASMR V):** May only be reimbursed if it results in a saving in treatment costs",1.0,13.251764705882355,False,True,0.7933729887008667,0.7185240189234415,b,False,2,3

== Objectives and Principles of Addictovigilance ==
The aim of addictovigilance is to monitor, assess, prevent, and manage the risk of abuse, misuse, and dependence linked to the consumption of any psychoactive substance, whether medicinal or not, plant or product, excluding alcohol and tobacco.

Addictovigilance in France is based on a network of 13 ""Centres d'√âvaluation et d'Information sur la pharmacod√©pendance - Addictovigilance"" (CEIP-A) run by the ANSM.

== Missions of the Addictovigilance Centres ==

- Collection of the information needed to assess the potential for abuse and dependence: Surveillance is based on the principle of notification. Notified cases are centralized in a national database managed by the ANSM and then transmitted to the European and WHO databases. The addictovigilance network conducts specific surveys in care centers specializing in drug user care (OPPIDUM), in pharmacies (OSIAP: suspicious prescriptions, indicators of possible abuse, ASOS: narcotic analgesics and secure prescriptions), and with toxicology analysts (DRAMES: deaths related to drug and substance abuse, DTA: toxic deaths by analgesics, chemical submission).
- Information and training for healthcare professionals, in response to questions or notifications, and as part of initial, specialist, and continuing training.
- Research contributing to scientific progress on the abuse and dependence potential of psychoactive substances.
- Expertise, advice, and investigation: The national addictovigilance investigation, requested by the ANSM, is carried out by a rapporteur. Its aim is to assess the risk of abuse, dependence, misuse, and abuse of a psychoactive substance, whether medicinal or otherwise, to confirm a potential signal, characterize a proven signal, monitor the risk profile of a medicinal product, or measure the impact of a regulatory measure.

== Assessment Methods in Addictovigilance ==
The assessment of the potential for substance abuse and dependence is carried out by means of the ""pharmacological and medical assessment of notifications"" (using the severity score based on the items in the definition of dependence, including physical dependence, patient-centeredness, and harmful consequences including somatic consequences, and misuse) and by analyzing the ""results of the various tools."" The choice of a global strategy and a multifaceted monitoring system implemented by the French addictovigilance network and its expertise in pharmacology is an innovative method of early detection of addictovigilance signals, making it possible to raise awareness and inform patients, users, and healthcare professionals quickly.",1.0,17.482857142857146,False,True,0.7709805965423584,0.7205044428507487,b,False,5,2

**Title:** Organ Donation

**Description:** Understanding the ethical issues and principles involved in organ removal and donation, including autonomy, presumed consent, anonymity, non-proprietary nature, restoration of the body, justice, and the roles of trusted support persons and relatives.

**Ethical and Legal Principles of Organ Donation**

The donation of organs (heart, kidney, liver, lungs, etc.) or other human body elements (blood, marrow, sperm, skin, corneas, etc.) is a crucial part of life-saving medical practice. This is a significant public health need, with around 5,000 transplants conducted annually, yet a waiting list of 13,000, leaving 8,000 patients waiting or at risk of death.

Healthcare professionals play a central role in raising awareness among the public, patients, and families. Studies indicate that public opinion has shifted positively, with 84% of French people supporting organ donation and agreeing to organ removal upon death. Donating organs is now viewed as a generous, altruistic gesture.

The Bioethics Laws have reinforced the principles of the Caillavet Law of 1976, the first law to establish organ donation in France. The current law is based on several principles:

- Removal for scientific or therapeutic purposes
- Respect for the human body: inviolable, not subject to property rights
- Rules governing consent
- Donation free of charge
- Anonymity between donor and recipient
- Diagnosis of death
- Health safety of human body part samples (screening for transmissible diseases)
- The role of the Agence de la Biom√©decine (ABM), responsible for managing the waiting list and allocating transplants

**Principles of Free and Anonymous Donation**

These principles are enshrined in French law. As Jean Rostand noted in 1966, any interference with a corpse is only acceptable if done with generous and noble intentions for clinical, scientific, or educational purposes.

In a society where free services are not guaranteed, there is a risk that all human activity could be subject to market laws. However, French medical practice opts for solidarity, ensuring universal healthcare access and equality. This tradition, rooted in Enlightenment philosophy, opposes the commercialization of people and bodies, preventing human trafficking and organ trade. It protects vulnerable individuals, such as living donors, from exploitation and ensures that heirs cannot trade in mortal remains.

Anonymity and secrecy reinforce the principle of gratuity, preventing contact between the donor's and recipient's environments. This respects and protects families' lives, avoiding abusive claims or delicate relationship issues, and facilitates mourning for the donor's family. It also respects the privacy of recipients, allowing them to convalesce with an organ or tissue foreign to their body.

As philosopher J. Derrida highlighted, giving does not imply reciprocity. Giving without expecting anything in return is an altruistic concept of total gratuitousness.

**Concerning Consent and the Issues It Raises**

Since 1976, consent is presumed for deceased donors unless they have expressed refusal during their lifetime. Deceased donors can express refusal through a national register or relatives' testimony.

Anyone aged 13 or over can register their refusal without a third party. This refusal can oppose samples for therapeutic, scientific medical autopsy, or research purposes, but not forensic autopsies, which are crucial for judicial processes. The register can specify which body parts are not to be donated.

For deceased minors or adults under guardianship, consent is obtained from parents or guardians. The law of 7 August 2004 specifies that doctors must ascertain from the trusted support person and close relations if the deceased expressed any opposition during their lifetime. The aim is to honor the deceased's wishes, not to express relatives' opinions. However, determining priority among family and friends can be complex.

The law encourages citizens to appoint a trusted support person to act as a witness. If designated, this person takes precedence over other relatives. Although not legally required, written consent and a signed donor card are important.

This delicate issue of consent highlights the educational and psychological role of coordination teams responsible for sample collection and dialogue with next of kin.",1.0,11.784285714285716,False,True,0.8261353373527527,0.7122846841812134,b,False,5,4

**Rubric:** Definition

== Definitions ==

A medical accident is an undesirable event that occurs during an act of care, prevention, or diagnosis. This accident results in abnormal damage with regard to the foreseeable evolution of the state of health. It may occur in any healthcare setting: a public or private healthcare establishment, the practice of a self-employed healthcare professional, a medical analysis or radiology laboratory, a pharmacy, etc. A medical accident may be caused by an error on the part of a healthcare professional, or it may be the result of care provided in accordance with good practice, in which case it is known as a ""therapeutic hazard.""

Iatrogenic conditions refer to all the harmful effects that can be caused by a treatment or medical procedure. Iatrogenic effects occur when the treatment triggers new symptoms, distinct from those it was intended to treat. The iatrogenic effect may occur with or without misuse of the drug, whether this misuse is the fault of a healthcare professional or the patient. Iatrogenic disorders should therefore not be confused with medical errors. An iatrogenic condition is a consequence of taking a medicine, even if the indication was correct and the dosage correct. It is possible to be the victim of an iatrogenic condition without any error or fault on the part of the healthcare professional.",0.5,14.895384615384618,False,True,0.8231066465377808,0.8009903430938721,c,False,4,3

  - Otoscopy

- **New-born babies (objective tests):**
  - Induced acoustic emissions (OEAP) or automated auditory evoked potentials. Note that AEO may miss hearing loss due to auditory neuropathy (false negative).

- **Outside the neonatal period (subjective tests except tympanometry):**
  - Ensure the child is calm and quiet, provide reassurance.
  - Calibrated sound sources (Moatti box, sensory baby test): Observe behavioral reaction to sound stimulation, acutropic reflex (from 6 months, turns head towards object) or investigative orientation. The younger the child, the greater the intensity of sound required to obtain a response. Clear responses at 70 dB indicate no bilateral deafness in infants.
  - Voice test: Response to first name (after 6 months), familiar words, picture book (after 2 years), voice audiometry (after 4 years).
  - Headphone tonal audiometry if the child cooperates and understands (after 4 years).
  - Tympanometry: Detects tubal obstruction or serous otitis.

- ST segment depression (from V1 to V3 and in DII)  
- Decrease or even inversion of the T wave  
- Appearance of a ""pathological"" U wave in V3 and DII (slowing of repolarisation)

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

**Chronic Ischemia**

Chronic digestive ischaemia primarily affects elderly patients and is more common in women, accounting for over 70% of cases. This condition is uncommon and indicative of advanced and diffuse atheromatous disease.

- **Functional Signs:** This is a triad associating:
  - **Postprandial Abdominal Pain (SD-004: Abdominal Pain):** Corresponds to claudication of the small intestine (mesenteric angina). It is the earliest and most constant symptom, consisting of intense cramp-like pain, often occurring in the periumbilical region. It begins around 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion and slowly subsides over one to two hours. Its severity and duration correlate with the quantity, calorie, and fat content of the meal and the degree of malperfusion. Initially, only large meals trigger the pain, but as lesions progress, pain becomes more frequent even after modest meals.
  - **Eviction and Food Splitting:** Postprandial pains lead patients to reduce food intake due to fear of pain, potentially resulting in severe malnutrition.
  - **Emaciation:** Often significant, resulting from malnutrition.

Other symptoms may include diarrhea and vomiting, though they are less typical.

- **Physical Signs:**
  - An abdominal murmur may be present. Clinical examination might reveal other atheromatous sites, such as carotid or femoral murmurs and abolition of peripheral pulses.

**Acute Intestinal Ischaemia**

Defined as the acute interruption of digestive vascularization due to acute arterial occlusion by embolism, thrombosis, or dissection. It is an absolute and vital therapeutic emergency.

Early diagnosis is crucial at the stage of reversible intestinal ischaemia. Acute abdominal pain in a patient at risk (>60 years old, atheromatous, embolic heart disease) should prompt this diagnosis due to its seriousness.

The spontaneous prognosis is extremely poor without treatment, rapidly leading to death. Even if blood flow is restored, the prognosis remains poor and depends on the extent of intestinal necrosis.

- **Functional Signs:**
  - **Abdominal Pain:** The most constant sign, characterized by sudden and intense cramp-like pain located in the umbilical region and right iliac fossa. The intensity of the pain contrasts with a poor physical examination and an initially stable general condition. Early stages often involve hyperperistalsis, which may manifest as diarrhea.

Within a few hours, intestinal obstruction develops (vomiting, defensiveness). General signs include fever, progressive shock, and multiple organ failure, indicating irreversible infarct.

- **Physical Signs:** A distinction can be made between:
  - **Reversible Acute Mesenteric Ischaemic Syndrome:** Characterized by very severe pain and absence of peritoneal signs.
  - **Intestinal Mesenteric Infarction:** Characterized by severe permanent pain with peritoneal signs (abdominal contracture), an occlusive state, and then a state of shock.",0.8,10.713333333333338,False,True,0.8140823841094971,0.659017284711202,c,False,2,4

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections of the skin and mucous membranes are very common. In the skin, they cause benign epithelial lesions, such as warts, and in the mucous membranes, condylomas.

Warts affect 7 to 10% of the general population, with a peak in frequency between the ages of 10 and 14.

**Common Clinical Aspects of Warts:**

- **Plantar Warts:** There are two anatomo-clinical varieties:
  - **Myrmecia (HPV1):** The most common type, characterized by deep warts that are painful on pressure, single or multiple. These are circumscribed by a thick keratotic ring partially covering the central region, which has a keratotic and papillomatous surface dotted with black dots (thrombosed capillaries).
  - **Mosaic Warts (HPV2):** Less common (1/4 of plantar warts), these are superficial, painless warts in keratotic plaques.

- **Common Vulgar Warts (HPV2):** Exophytic lesions with a surface bristling with greyish keratotic projections and occasional crevices. They vary in size and number and can sometimes be confluent. These are primarily localized on the dorsal surface of the hands and fingers, and more rarely on the palms or other cutaneous locations.

- **Common Flat Warts (HPV3):** Small, barely raised papules, yellow or buff in color, with a smooth or finely mamelinated surface. They occur mainly on the face, back of the hands, and limbs. Usually, they resolve in less than two years but can be chronic in immunocompromised patients.

**Treatment of Warts:**

- There is no specific treatment for HPV infections.
- Patients should be informed that these lesions are benign, there is a high risk of recurrence, and warts usually regress spontaneously. Therefore, warts should not be treated aggressively.
- Destruction (on request, on a case-by-case basis, depending on experience) can be performed using chemical keratolytics (salicylic acid-based preparations with protection of peripheral healthy skin) or physical cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen.",0.6666666666666666,7.698823529411765,False,True,0.734526515007019,0.797374407450358,d,False,2,4

The general scheme is based on a hierarchy of national, regional, and local bodies, structured by type of risk, managed jointly, and placed under the supervision of the Ministries responsible for social security (Ministry of Solidarity and Health and Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Recovery).

**Population Groups Covered**

When social security was created, the General Scheme covered salaried workers in the private sector. It has since expanded to include groups such as students, the unemployed, and government contract workers, who are not employed in the private sector. France aims to achieve universal coverage of the population, regardless of their contribution to the financing of social security.

The general scheme is currently the largest in terms of the number of people covered (nearly 30 million), including those covered for sickness, family, retirement, industrial accidents, and occupational diseases.

Since 2018, following the abolition of the Social Scheme for the Self-Employed (RSI), the general scheme has managed the social risks of the self-employed, including tradespeople, industrialists, shopkeepers, and non-regulated liberal professions.

**Organization**

Since the ""Jeanneney"" decree of 21 August 1967 on the administrative and financial organization of social security, the General Scheme has been divided into branches of activity headed by an autonomous national fund.

- The Family branch is managed by the Caisse nationale des allocations familiales (Cnaf). It supports families in their daily lives, childcare, access to housing, and the fight against poverty and disability.
  
- The Sickness, Occupational Injuries, and Occupational Risks branch is managed by the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM). It covers risks related to sickness, maternity, disability, death, accidents at work, and occupational diseases.

- The Old Age branch is managed by the Caisse nationale d'assurance vieillesse (CNAV). It pays basic retirement pensions.

Additionally, the laws of 7 August 2020 introduce a fifth branch of social security to cover the risk of loss of autonomy and disability. This new branch will be managed by the Caisse nationale de solidarit√© pour l'autonomie (CNSA).

Two other branches perform common, cross-functional tasks:

- The social security contribution collection branch is managed by the Urssaf Caisse nationale. It collects resources allocated to other branches of social security through local offices - the Urssaf.

- The F√©d√©ration des employeurs du R√©gime g√©n√©ral de la S√©curit√© sociale is managed by the Union des caisses nationales de s√©curit√© sociale (UCANSS). It handles social dialogue, shared human resources management tasks, and missions of common interest, such as property operations or sustainable development policies.

**Summary Diagram**

The general scheme will have four autonomous branches in 2021. The autonomy branch will be the fifth branch and is currently being set up.

Each branch is headed by a national fund (a public administrative body), which coordinates and manages a network of regional funds.

**Rubric:** Definition  

== Benign Tumours ==

The general characteristics of benign tumours include well-defined contours, slow growth, and local evolution limited to the breast.

=== Adenofibroma ===

Adenofibroma is a mixed epithelial and conjunctival proliferation occurring in young women (under 25-30 years), including adolescents. It presents as a swelling that is usually painless, well-limited, and mobile in relation to the skin and the rest of the mammary gland. It is generally less than 30 mm in size, with a firm (renitent) consistency, without any local signs or suspicious adenopathy.

=== Fibrocystic Mastopathy (FMK) ===

This is the most common benign breast disease in women aged between 35 and 50, which may persist after menopause in women taking HRT. It is revealed by the presence of mastodynia associated with menstrual cycles. Clinical examination reveals:

- A single or multiple, rounded, well-defined, mobile mass of variable consistency (usually soft), which may be tender or even painful (cyst under tension).
- Ambiguous, sensitive discharge, sometimes nipple discharge (whitish, greenish, thick).
- Absence of suspicious axillary adenopathy.

== Carcinoma ""In Situ"" ==

There are two types of ""in situ"" (non-invasive) carcinoma of the breast: ductal carcinoma ""in situ"" (also known as intracanal) and lobular carcinoma ""in situ"". The cells involved have no metastatic potential because they do not cross the basement membrane.

== Malignant Tumours ==

Anatomopathological analysis is used to confirm the diagnosis and assess prognostic and predictive factors. In the majority of cases, breast cancers are non-specific infiltrating adenocarcinomas (usually abbreviated to carcinomas), also known as infiltrating ductal carcinomas.

Anatomopathology will specify the following elements:

- Histological type (non-specific infiltrating carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carcinoma, etc.)

There are several types of cleft:

- **Primary cleft palate (lateralized):** More or less complete damage to the opening of the nostril, upper lip, and alveolar arch as far as the nasopalatine canal. It can be unilateral (most frequent) or bilateral.
- **Secondary cleft palate (medial):** Involvement of the nasopalatine canal as far as the uvula, resulting in communication between the oral cavity and the nasal cavities. Partial forms include cleft palate (bifid uvula).

**Title:** Knowing the Profile of Memory Disorders in AD

**Description:** Episodic Memory Consolidation Disorder

Memory complaints are by far the most common symptom leading to the diagnosis of AD. It is a form of ""forgetfulness as you go along"" (for example, the patient repeats the same thing several times), reflecting an inability to form a lasting memory from an event experienced (Abnormal memory disorders/cognitive decline (SD-131)). It is not uncommon for the patient to minimize the complaint (anosognosia), while family and friends are concerned about it (Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders (SD-298)).

On neuropsychological assessment, the most characteristic memory impairment in AD is ""episodic memory consolidation disorder."" In the typical form of AD, episodic memory disorders predominate over other cognitive impairments, even in more advanced disease.

In verbal episodic memory tests (consisting of learning a list of words), the consolidation disorder is characterized by:

- No encoding difficulties (the patient can immediately recall the list of words).
- A collapse in the ability to recall words on a delayed basis (after a delay of a few minutes and an intercurrent cognitive challenge).
- Above all, the absence or weakness of the help provided by category clues (example of a clue, for the word ""truck"": ""what was the vehicle?""), with clues often causing ""intrusions"" (the patient evoking words that were not part of the original list); the absence of help from the clue distinguishes the consolidation disorder from a recovery disorder where the clue is sufficient to make the patient restore the missing words.

Consolidation disorder can be suspected by means of the ""five-word test,"" a simple test of verbal episodic memory that can be suggested in a medical consultation. It is proven by neuropsychological assessment by a neuropsychologist, using tests such as the 16-item ""free recall/indexed recall.""

This profile of memory impairment:

- As opposed to other types of memory deficits secondary to attention or executive function disorders, which impair the quality of encoding or retrieval of information (but not directly consolidation), as is the case in depression or anxiety, sleep disorders, excessive use of psychotropic drugs (see item 108 Knowing the main differential diagnoses of AD and item 132 Differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders).
- Results from damage to the Papez circuit, and in particular to hippocampal structures (cf item 108 Specify the principles of topographical reasoning when faced with a dementia syndrome).
- Is a good clinical argument in favor of AD (see item 132 Positive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease).

**Title:** Knowing the Definition and Mechanisms of Discrimination  
**Description:** Stereotypes, Stigmatization Phenomena  
**Rubric:** Definition  

**Definitions**

Discrimination involves making a difference in treatment based on prohibited criteria, resulting in harm to the individual. International conventions list criteria that should not be used to treat people differently, including ethnicity, political opinions, gender identity, sexual orientation, and nationality. In France, discrimination also includes differences in treatment based on surname, ability to express oneself in French, physical appearance, place of residence, loss of autonomy, and being a beneficiary of the Compl√©mentaire Sant√© Solidaire or Aide M√©dicale d'Etat.

Medical ethics prohibit all discrimination, but this does not mean that any selection of populations is discrimination. The Hippocratic Oath states: ""My first concern will be to restore, preserve or promote health in all its elements, physical and mental, individual and social. I will respect all persons without any discrimination according to their condition or beliefs."" The Public Health Code requires health professionals to ""listen to, examine, advise or treat all persons with the same conscience, regardless of their origin, morals or family situation, their membership or non-membership of a particular ethnic group, nation or religion, their disability or state of health, their reputation or any feelings they may have towards them."" (Public Health Code, art. R. 4127-7)

There are cases where it may be legitimate to make differences, even on prohibited grounds such as nationality. For example, in 2007, recommendations for vaccination against tuberculosis targeted specific populations (children born in a highly endemic country or whose parents are from that country). The Directorate General for Health consulted the Human Rights Defender, who stated that this targeted health policy did not constitute discrimination, given the public health issues and the proportionate nature of the proposed rules. However, vigilance was advised to ensure the measure was not used to monitor the residency status of the target groups.

**Refusal of Care as Discrimination**

Refusal of care occurs when certain people are denied treatment due to socio-administrative status. For example, Ms. B., a Romanian national, was refused a consultation despite having an appointment with a GP. The doctor cited two reasons: the patient was in receipt of State Medical Aid (AME), complicating payment, and the patient did not speak or understand French well. Following a complaint, the doctor was reminded that it is forbidden to refuse treatment based on health cover (Article 1110-3 of the Public Health Code). Administrative difficulties and communication issues do not justify refusal of care. In this case, the refusal was discriminatory and unlawful.

**Professional Law and Harm to Individuals**

Some refusals of care are legitimate, such as when care requested does not fall within a professional's remit. Health professionals may refuse care for professional or personal reasons, except in emergencies or where it would lack humanity (French Public Health Code, art. R. 4127-47). However, refusal of care must not harm the individual, whose right to health is affirmed by high normative texts, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1976, the European Social Charter of 1961 and 1996, and in France, the Preamble to the Constitution of 1946.

**The Reality of Discrimination in Access to Healthcare in France Today**

Discrimination is difficult to measure and understand. Testing is widely used to establish the presence of discrimination, describing differences in treatment by healthcare professionals for equivalent clinical cases with distinct socio-cultural variables. A 2019 study highlighted strong discrimination based on economic vulnerability, with explicit refusals of care for 10 to 15% of the 1,500 professionals contacted. Discrimination based on origin was also found in some regions.

Refusal of care is not always explicit and can take insidious forms, such as late or unusual appointment scheduling, repeated referrals without medical reason, refusal to draw up an estimate, non-compliance with tariffs, and refusal to waive advance payment for compliant beneficiaries. Complaints about discriminatory treatment are rare due to difficulty establishing facts and lack of awareness of appeal bodies.

**Psycho-Social Mechanisms: Stereotypes and Prejudice**

Testing can reveal discriminatory behavior on a large scale but does not establish discriminatory ""intent."" Discrimination is a structural phenomenon with real consequences, producing new inequalities. Racist or homophobic acts are part of a continuum for the discriminated person, linked to a stereotyped identity. Stereotypes are simplifying representations, while prejudices are preconceived, generally depreciatory opinions about a group.

**Labelling Patients and Prioritizing Complaints**

Doctors use categories to classify patients, which can lead to discrimination. Labels like ""CMU patient"" carry simplifying connotations and are not based on scientific knowledge. For example, Mrs. R., an Iranian national, experienced severe pain during childbirth. The midwife attributed it to a ""Mediterranean syndrome,"" a stereotype with no scientific basis. Such culturalist analysis can lead to discrimination.

**Socio-Historical Mechanisms of Discrimination**

Discrimination can be direct, indirect, or systemic, primarily affecting vulnerable populations exposed to greater risks. Discrimination in housing, employment, and leisure affects quality of life and health. Social policies can reinforce health inequalities, and policies targeting disadvantaged groups can inadvertently stigmatize them.",1.0,19.146315789473686,False,True,0.7288580536842346,0.4080561300118764,b,False,2,4

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Physiopathology

Not all fetuses are equal when faced with maternal smoking or passive smoking. The effect of smoking requires the interaction of multiple factors: socio-demographic, epidemiological, or genetic.

Tobacco smoke contains more than 4,000 toxic products, some of which are metabolized by cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase. The genes encoding these two enzymes have been studied in mothers who smoke. In the group of low-weight children, more patients were found to have a polymorphism in one or other of these two genes.

Among the toxic substances, nicotine is the most addictive. There is a dose effect between maternal smoking and fetal impairment. However, the effect of smoking seems to be more marked in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, since patients who successfully stop smoking in the 1st trimester and 2nd trimester have newborns whose birth weight is hardly any different from that of non-smoking mothers.

**Title:** Biomedical Research: Protecting and Respecting People

**Description:** Ethical principles of research include purpose, Nuremberg Code and Declaration of Helsinki, fair information, free and informed consent, independent ethics committee, justice (non-discrimination, fair access to trials), and scientific integrity.

**Definition:**

== Ethical Principles of Research Involving Humans (Biomedical Research) ==

Research Involving Humans (RIPH) is defined as research organized and conducted on human beings, extending beyond the act of care and the immediate interest of the patient. It aims to develop biological or medical knowledge through procedures that modify usual, validated treatments. This includes tests and experiments on humans involving new drugs, surgical techniques, diagnostic methods that are invasive or risky, or psychological and behavioral studies.

A clinical trial is a scientific study in human medical therapeutics to assess the safety and efficacy of a diagnostic method or treatment. It includes a preclinical phase conducted in vitro and in vivo in animals, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in four phases.

== Principles and Objectives of Research Ethics ==

The aim is to apply fundamental ethical principles in research. These principles can be implemented through normative texts, such as French laws and universal declarations, and by protocol validation by bodies like the Committee for the Protection of Individuals.

Vigilance is required regarding the quality of information and consent before research, the vulnerability of certain populations, safety conditions, monitoring throughout the experiment, and post-approval marketing. Patents for industrial development must not lead to financial conflicts of interest or inequalities in healthcare access.

The guiding principles of ethical research concern methodology, objectives, study conditions, consent collection, vigilance towards vulnerable populations, publication integrity, and clinical management post-study. These principles include beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice.

=== Principle of Beneficence ===

This involves relieving or preventing physical or psychological pain, doing what is best for the patient (including sometimes doing nothing if the anticipated benefit is minimal), and carefully assessing the risk/benefit balance of the treatment.

=== Principle of Non-Maleficence ===

This principle involves not causing harm through research and immediately halting any research with irreversible or significant harmful effects. In France, the Public Health Code states that ""the interests of persons who undergo medical research always take precedence over the sole interests of science and society.""

=== Principle of Autonomy ===

This principle allows each person the capacity to think, decide, and act freely, including decisions concerning their health. Subjects should be treated as autonomous persons, protecting those with diminished autonomy, respecting the subject's wishes, and ensuring quality information and consent gathering.

Under French law, the human body is inviolable, making it impossible to carry out treatment without consent. Consent must be informed, free from pressure, and based on complete, fair, and appropriate information. It is crucial to ensure the information is understood.

=== Principle of Justice (or Equity) ===

With declining and scarce economic resources, priorities must be established to preserve equity in healthcare access. This access must be identical across countries. Within a country, health strategies and policies must consider public and individual health priorities. In research, subject selection must be fair, protecting vulnerable populations, with no exclusion or discrimination based on religious, political, or ethnic background.

=== Universal Nature ===

Ethical principles are universal and transcend geographical, cultural, economic, legal, and political boundaries. However, their application depends on the laws or regulations in force in the country. For example, patent marketing is prohibited in France but allowed in other countries, leading to inequalities in care access.

== The Emergence of Research Ethics ==

Since ancient times, concern and respect for the patient have been central to medical practice, as evidenced by the Hippocratic oath. However, societal views on doctors have changed. Until the early 20th century, the focus was on doing what was best for the patient, with doctors making decisions they deemed best. Patients trusted doctors to make therapeutic decisions, with beneficence prevailing and medical paternalism at its height.

In the early 20th century, attitudes shifted with technological developments. Effectiveness proof was sought in medical, police, and industrial fields. The principle of beneficence gave way to autonomy, with consent collection legitimizing research. By the end of World War II, abuses became apparent, necessitating a regulatory framework. The Nuremberg Code was introduced in 1947.

== Normative Texts ==

=== Nuremberg Code (1947) ===

Drafted by non-medical experts after the Nuremberg trials, the Nuremberg Code establishes an international code of ethics for human experimentation. It respects beneficence and non-maleficence, requiring research to benefit society and properly assess benefits and risks. It respects autonomy, requiring free and informed consent, with subjects able to withdraw at any time.

=== Declaration of Helsinki (1964) ===

Issued by the World Medical Association, the Declaration of Helsinki builds on the Nuremberg Code's principles, distinguishing between clinical and non-clinical research and research for direct patient benefit. It states that ""the interests of science or society must never take precedence over the well-being of the subject.""

=== Manila Declaration (1981) ===

Issued by the WHO and the Council for International Organisations of Medical Sciences, the Manila Declaration requires independent expert committee opinions before obtaining consent from vulnerable persons, including children, pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and protected adults.

=== European Directive of 4 April 2001 ===

This directive incorporates Helsinki and Manila declarations' principles for individual protection. It aims to harmonize European clinical trial legislation on medicinal products, improving trial quality research and facilitating procedures and information exchanges through European databases.

=== Revision of the Helsinki Declaration (2014) ===

The tenth revision introduces public consultation as a working method, addresses compensation for vulnerable populations, and reiterates the post-study obligation to communicate overall and individual results.",1.0,18.19909090909091,False,True,0.679028332233429,0.7320182720820109,d,False,4,4

**Description:** Location, rhythm, irradiation, inspection, palpation, mobility, neurological examination. Differential diagnosis: visceral, vascular causes, etc.

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

When faced with acute low back pain, it is important to rule out other possible causes before accepting the diagnosis of common acute low back pain (spinal and mechanical origin of the pain). We will distinguish between acute low back pain of common and mechanical origin and acute low back pain of secondary origin.

**The Interview States:**

- Antecedents (neoplastic, infectious, etc.)
- Circumstances of onset (after exertion, lifting, etc.)
- Main site of pain (low back pain, right or left lumbar fossa, etc.) and intensity
- Pain radiations (iliac fossa, hypogastric region, inguinal fold, etc.)
- Rhythm of pain: mechanical or inflammatory
- Course of pain (progressive worsening, resistant to medical treatment, etc.)
- History of low back pain: previous similar episodes, evolution of the pain, etc.
- Absence of general signs (fever, adenopathy, etc.) or associated signs (nausea/vomiting, micturition problems, paresthesias, etc.)

**The Clinical Examination Looks For:**

- Disorder of spinal statics, analgesic attitude in relation to the lumbago
- Painful points on palpation of the spine, often with stiffness in the lumbago
- Cellulo-myalgic syndrome opposite the painful areas
- Sacroiliac, hip, and gluteal pain as part of the differential diagnosis

A neurological examination will rule out radiculalgia or cauda equina. A general and visceral examination will be carried out depending on the associated signs and the context.

**The Main Urological Causes of Acute Low Back Pain Are:**

- Nephritic colic (265)
- Acute pyelonephritis (161)

**Other Urological Causes of Acute Low Back Pain Include:**

- Renal infarction (emboligenic condition: atrial fibrillation (232), valve wearers (153), vascular nephropathy (263))
- Renal trauma (334)
- Projected testicular pain (torsion, orchi-epididymitis) (50)
- Polycystic kidney disease (266)
- Retroperitoneal fibrosis

**Non-Urological Causes of Acute Low Back Pain Include:**

- Nephrology: proteinuria (259), acute conglomerulonephritis (261), thrombosis of renal artery stenosis (263), acute renal failure (348)
- Visceral:
  - Mesenteric infarction, gastric ulcer (272), inflammatory bowel disease (282)
  - Right: cholecystitis (277), angiocholitis (277), hepatitis (167), acute appendicitis (356), pancreatitis (358)
  - Left: splenic infarction, pancreatitis (358), acute diverticulitis (287)
- Vascular: aortic aneurysm (fissuring, dissection 225)
- Gynaecological: ectopic pregnancy (24, 26), ovarian cyst, endometriosis (41)
- Pulmonary: acute pneumonia (154), pleural effusion (206), pneumothorax (360), acute chest pain (230), pulmonary embolism (226)

**Title:** Know the indications, procedures for performing, analyzing, and interpreting blood cultures.  
**Description:** None  

**Indications:**  

Blood cultures must be taken if bacteremia or fungemia is suspected:  

- Fever (with or without chills) associated with one of the following criteria:  
  - Purpura febrile  
  - Need for hospitalization or fever occurring during hospitalization  
  - Special circumstances (asplenia, neutropenia, presence of a vascular catheter)  
  - Hypothermia with or without signs of organ failure (see Sepsis and septic shock)  
  - Hypotension, tachycardia associated with signs of poor peripheral perfusion (mottling, cold extremities, prolonged skin recoloration time)  

- Suspicion of endocarditis: Perform three pairs of blood cultures, even in the absence of fever  

- If fungemia is suspected (catheter, febrile immunosuppressed patient on antibiotics, digestive surgery, etc.), blood cultures on fungal flasks are indicated, as these media inhibit bacterial growth, which prevents yeasts from growing.  

Blood cultures do not need to be taken at the time of a fever peak or when shivering.  

**How Blood Cultures Are Taken:**  

- Compliance with asepsis rules: hand hygiene, careful skin antisepsis of the puncture area (using an alcoholic antiseptic solution), wearing gloves, etc.  
- Puncture of a peripheral vein  
- If the patient has a central catheter: concomitant blood cultures on the catheter  
- Inoculation of at least 2 bottles (1 pair): aerobic then anaerobic  
- If signs of severity: collect 4 to 6 vials during a single puncture (do not delay antibiotic therapy)  
- In the absence of serious signs:  
  - 4 to 6 vials are taken with 10 ml/vial (approximately 1 CFU of bacteria/mL of blood): maximum sensitivity with 40-60 mL of blood, so the vials must be well filled  
  - To be taken at the same time or 30 minutes apart, except if endocarditis is suspected = spread over the first 24 hours  

- In children, if venipuncture is difficult (often the case in infants), it is preferable to fill a single blood culture bottle with a large quantity of blood rather than multiplying the bottles with a small quantity of blood  
- Samples should be taken before any antibiotic therapy, except in cases of purpura fulminans  

**Analysis of Blood Cultures in the Laboratory:**  

- After transfer to the microbiology laboratory, the vials are introduced into the automated system for monitoring (detection of bacterial/fungal growth)  
- If culture positive (within 24-48 hours for most bacteria): direct examination (Gram stain) and clinician informed  
- Then carry out the antibiotic susceptibility test (requires a further 24 hours)  
- Inform the microbiologist of suspected endocarditis: incubation period 10 to 14 days  
- Inform the microbiologist/mycologist of immunosuppressive factors requiring cryptococcosis testing (incubation period 3 to 4 weeks)  
- Fungal blood cultures: positive in 1 to 5 days (confirmation of the presence of yeasts or filaments by MGG or Giemsa staining). Immediate communication to the clinician to start probabilistic antifungal treatment  
- Fungal subcultures for identification and antifungal gram: minimum delay 3 days  
- Techniques for more rapid identification of the microorganism exist (PCR, mass spectrometry) but are not available in all laboratories  

**Interpretation of a Positive Fungal Blood Culture:**  

- Any flask positive for ""Candida"" spp or ""Cryptococcus neoformans"" should be taken into consideration and treated  
- The detection of rare yeasts should be discussed with the mycologist  
- Malassezia yeasts are responsible for fungemia in neonatology  

**Interpretation of Blood Cultures: Contamination During Puncture or ""True"" Bacteremia?**  

Take into account the number of positive vials and the microbial species:  

- Infectious agents that are always pathogenic (always a true bacteremia): Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other pyogenic streptococci, Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria, Brucella, Pasteurella, and Candida  
- Possible contaminants (because they belong to the skin flora):  
  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Cutibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp., and Bacillus spp.  
  - To conclude that bacteremia has been caused by these bacteria, the following is required:  
    - A compatible context (catheter or endovascular equipment in place)  
    - At least 2 positive blood culture bottles from 2 different pairs with the same bacterial species presenting the same antibiotic sensitivity phenotype (same antibiogram)  ",0.25,10.723333333333333,False,True,0.8587044477462769,0.7231578230857849,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Knowing the Most Common Clinical Manifestations of Internal Hemorrhoids  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

Haemorrhoidal symptoms linked to the internal plexuses can be expressed in two ways: either noisily over a short period of time (haemorrhoidal crisis) or as long-lasting symptoms accentuated during and after defecation.

Haemorrhoidal crisis combines, to varying degrees, a sensation of burning, tension, or sharp pain in the anus, red defecatory bleeding (anal epistaxis) which can be significant but is not mixed with stool, and sensitive anal swelling or a perception of internal tension. Symptoms occur rapidly and last for a few days, often accentuated by defecation.

When the signs become chronic, they often include defecatory and post-defecatory anal burning that does not last long, more or less significant prolapse of the anus that is more or less reducible after defecation, and bleeding. These symptoms may develop periodically. Anal pruritus is a complaint often attributed to haemorrhoids, but the causal relationship is tenuous. It should not be considered a haemorrhoidal symptom, particularly if it is chronic. Instrumental or surgical treatment of haemorrhoids should not be proposed in cases of chronic anal pruritus.

The classification of haemorrhoidal tissue into grades is classic:

- Grade I: No prolapse in the anoscopic lumen.
- Grade II: Prolapse in the lumen of the anoscopy but not outside.
- Grade III: Prolapse outside the anus during pushing but spontaneous reintegration at the end of pushing.
- Grade IV: Permanent prolapse from the outset. In this situation, the internal haemorrhoids are visible outside the anus, and anoscopy is often not necessary to visualize them.

The important value of the clinical examination lies not only in describing the haemorrhoidal tissue but also in looking for associated lesions: anal fissure in the radiating folds (often at the posterior pole of the anus, the anal fissure is an inspection diagnosis), anal abscess or fistula, condyloma, marisci, cancer of the anal canal or rectum.",0.5,15.725000000000005,False,True,0.8188375234603882,0.6482526063919067,c,False,4,3

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

== Suggestive Circumstances ==
AOMI may be asymptomatic. It should be suspected by the discovery of a vascular murmur or by the abolition of peripheral pulses in a subject with cardiovascular risk factors.

Symptomatic AOMI manifests as either muscular pain on walking (claudication) forcing the patient to stop walking, or by permanent pain of a limb, or by a trophic disorder associated or not (symptoms at rest).

Sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors should be investigated for OSA.

== Diagnosis ==
A clinical and haemodynamic classification is used. It is based on the search for symptoms and the measurement of perfusion pressures: systolic ankle pressure index (SAPI = ratio of ankle pressure to brachial pressure), ankle pressure, and big toe pressure.

A distinction is made between:
- Asymptomatic patients (SPI ‚â§ 0.90)
- Claudication: exertional ischaemia stage (SPI ‚â§ 0.90)
- Symptoms at rest: permanent ischaemia stage (ankle pressure < 50 mmHg or big toe pressure < 30 mmHg)

In the case of diabetes or chronic renal failure, the GPI and ankle pressure are often inaccurate due to arterial stiffness (calcification of the arterial wall). Diagnosis is then based on the measurement of pressure at the big toe (digital pressure). Any finding of an SPI >1.4 should systematically lead to a measurement of toe pressure. The diagnosis of AOMI is accepted in the event of toe pressure < 0.7.

The functional classification of Leriche and Fontaine is no longer used.

== Differential Diagnoses ==
The main differential diagnoses of claudication and their characteristics are detailed below:

- **Origin**: 
  - Arterial: Always the same distance of onset, cramp-like pain requiring rapid cessation of exercise, fast recovery, atheromatous context.
  - Venous: Variable distance of onset, progressive sensation of painful swelling that does not force cessation of exercise, slow recovery, deep venous thrombosis of a collecting trunk.
  - Articular: Pain from the first steps, maximum joint topography from the outset, slow recovery, arthrosis, trauma sequelae, inflammatory rheumatism.

**Description:** Understanding the main legal provisions concerning the use and conservation of elements and products of the human body.

**Definition**

== I. What are Products and Elements of the Human Body? ==
The ""elements"" of the human body include organs, tissues, and cells. The ""products"" are renewable, such as blood and gametes. Fingernails, hair, and teeth, known as ""phanera,"" are excluded from this discussion. The focus is on three categories:

- Blood and its components, including labile blood products.
- Organs, which can only be used as part of a donation.
- Tissues or cells, including haematopoietic cells from bone marrow, cord blood, or placental blood, embryonic or foetal tissues or cells, cord and placental cells, gametes, etc.

== II. Principles Governing These Products and Elements ==
These products and elements are not ordinary commodities. While the human body is fundamentally unavailable for alienation, its products and elements can be used for therapeutic purposes. This availability is governed by three main principles:

- **Non-economic Ownership:** ""The human body, its elements, and products cannot be the subject of an economic right"" (Civil Code, art. 16-1). They cannot be traded or priced.
- **Informed Consent:** The removal of elements and collection of products require the donor's prior consent, as per legal procedures (article 1211-2 of the Public Health Code). Products and elements may be used for other purposes if the informed person does not object.
- **Anonymity:** Article 16-8 of the French Civil Code states that no information may be divulged to identify the donor or recipient. Only the donor's and recipient's doctors may access identifying information in therapeutic necessity.

These principles vary in application. For instance, a transfusion of renewable blood cells does not pose the same ethical issues as organ transplantation or gamete donation (Thibert, 2020).

== III. Ethical Issues Beyond the Legal Framework ==
- Elements and products may be part of biological collections or ""biobanks,"" raising questions about sample ownership, donor withdrawal rights, health data protection, and potential commercialization (Clarizio et al., 2022).
- In gamete donation for medically assisted procreation (MAP), donor and recipient identities remain anonymous. The 2021 Bioethics Act allows people born from donated gametes or embryos to access donor information upon reaching adulthood.
- For organ removal from the living, consent follows information on risks and consequences. In ""post-mortem"" removal, presumed consent assumes no refusal is registered. This raises ethical issues, as presumed consent may not equate to genuine consent. Dialogue with the deceased's next of kin is essential, especially if the deceased did not explicitly express their wishes regarding organ donation.

**Definitions**

The distinction between central and peripheral facial paralysis is based firstly on the characteristics of the motor impairment (Muscular weakness (SDD-074); Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit (SDD-121); Facial paralysis (SDD-127)). When significant, it can lead to difficulty in speaking (dysphonia (SD-146)), chewing, or even swallowing (swallowing disorders and false swallowing (SDD-062)).

**Diagnosis of Central Facial Paralysis**

- Predominantly affects the lower facial region: the nasolabial fold is obliterated, the labial commissure falls away, it is impossible to puff out the cheeks, and the mouth is drawn to the healthy side when smiling.
- Often associated with a motor deficit in the homolateral hemisphere (hemiplegia) (Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit (SDD-121)).
- Typically involves automatic-voluntary dissociation: asymmetry more marked in voluntary movements than in automatic ones (dissociation sometimes reversed).

**Diagnosis of Peripheral Facial Paralysis (PFP)**

- Equivalent damage to the upper and lower facial regions.
- Superior involvement leads to incomplete closure of the eye, revealing an upward tilting of the eyeball (Charles Bell's sign) and to erasure of the forehead wrinkles. In frustrated forms, the eyelashes are more apparent and longer on the paralysed side than on the healthy side when the eyes are forcefully occluded (Souques eyelash sign) (palpebral anomalies (SD-139)).
- Absence of automatic-voluntary dissociation.
- Other symptoms and signs: abolished corneal reflex (damage to the orbicularis muscle, innervated by the facial nerve), cutaneous hypoesthesia in the Ramsay-Hunt area, painful hyperacusis (damage to the stapedial muscle), agueusia of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, drying up of lacrimal secretions.",0.75,12.690000000000001,False,True,0.8014184832572937,0.6030456125736237,c,False,2,3

Cardiogenic shock is defined as the inability of the heart to generate sufficient blood flow to meet the metabolic needs of peripheral organs. The drop in cardiac output results in hypoperfusion and tissue anoxia, leading to failure of the peripheral organs concerned (kidney, liver, brain).

- Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg
- Urine output < 30 mL/h or cold extremities
- Cardiac index < 2.2 l/min/m¬≤ with capillary pressure > 15 mmHg

Be familiar with the main sources of bias.  
**Rubric:** Definition  

**Definitions**

There are two sources of error in estimating a parameter:

- **Random Error:** Due to sampling fluctuation, it causes a decrease in the precision of estimates. It depends on sample size; the larger the sample size, the more precise the estimates.
- **Systematic Error (Bias):** Not due to chance, the presence of major bias invalidates the results of a study. It is independent of sample size.

**Three Major Families of Bias:**

- **Selection Bias:** Linked to the choice of method of selection and/or follow-up (attrition bias linked to loss to follow-up in longitudinal studies) of subjects, leading to the sample analyzed ultimately corresponding to a population different from the target population. It threatens the representativeness and external validity of the study.
- **Classification Bias:** Linked to the measurement of exposure and/or the judgment criterion. The reality of an individual's status (e.g., truly obese) is not correctly collected in the study (e.g., faulty scales systematically giving 3 kilos less). Memory bias is an example of information bias linked to the unreliability of self-reported data.
- **Confusion Bias:** Related to the fact that the observed relationship between an exposure factor and the health phenomenon studied may be distorted by not taking into account a third factor (confounding factor) itself associated with both the exposure factor and the phenomenon studied.

**Selection and Information Biases:**

- They relate to descriptive and analytical objectives.
- They may lead to an over- or under-estimation of measures of frequency and measures of association.
- They result from errors (avoidable or not) committed by the investigators (e.g., diagnostic errors, wrong choice of control group, refusal of participation of eligible subjects, lost to follow-up in a cohort). They must be identified and controlled at the time of protocol preparation and cannot be corrected at the time of analysis.

**Confounding Biases:**

- They relate only to analytic objectives.
- They may lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the measures of association.
- They do not arise from errors made by the investigators but reflect the nature of things. They should be anticipated when planning the study (e.g., restriction of inclusion criteria, matching, randomization if possible, collection of potential confounders) and can be corrected in the analysis (e.g., stratification, adjustment).",1.0,9.255714285714287,False,True,0.7358168959617615,0.7682060798009237,c,False,2,3

Gestational age is determined by early ultrasound (10-12 weeks' amenorrhoea (SA)) or, if unavailable, from the date of the last menstrual period. Birth is considered ""at term"" if it occurs between 37 and 41 weeks' amenorrhoea.

The maturation of the newborn is assessed clinically by morphological and neurological criteria, particularly tonus and archaic reflexes (""Examination of the term newborn (SD-039)"").

**Neonatal Tone**

- **Passive Tone** (the more mature the newborn, the more flexed the posture):  
  - Spontaneous quadriflexion posture  
  - Return to flexion of the upper limbs after extension by the examiner  
  - Scarf sign  
  - Examination of angles: popliteal angle (‚â§90¬∞), dorsiflexion of the foot (between 0 and 20¬∞), heel-ear angle (‚â§90¬∞), adductor angles (between 40 and 70¬∞)

- **Active Tone**:  
  - Pull-sit manoeuvre  
  - Full sit-up

**Title:** Infectious Eruptive Diseases: Kawasaki Disease  
**Description:** Epidemiology (B), Clinical Features (A), Referral (Hospitalization (A), Management (B))  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

**Epidemiology/Physiopathology**

- Vasculitis of the medium-sized vessels, with an unknown precise pathophysiology: a combination of immune and environmental factors (including infection) in a genetically predisposed background.
- Affects young children (< 5 years).
- More frequent in certain populations (Asia), with severe forms like ""Kawasaki Shock"" more common in Afro-Caribbeans.
- Recently (April 2020), a ""Kawasaki-like"" syndrome called Pediatric Multi-Systemic Inflammation Syndrome (PIMS) was described following infection with SARS-CoV-2, differing from Kawasaki by a greater frequency of myocardial damage.

**Clinical Features**

The diagnosis is based on several factors.

**Complete Classical Form:**

- Combines a fever lasting 5 days or more and 4 of the following major criteria:
  - Maculopapular exanthema or diffuse erythema of the trunk and limbs with early fine desquamation at day 5.
  - Involvement of the extremities with erythema of the palms and soles and/or edema of the hands and feet and/or subacute fine desquamation (later, around day 10).
  - Bilateral non-suppurative bulbar conjunctivitis.
  - Oropharyngeal involvement: glossitis and/or cheilitis and/or pharyngitis.
  - Cervical adenopathies > 1.5 cm, bilateral but possibly unilateral (or asymmetric), which can sometimes lead to the diagnosis of a phlegmon.

Note: The major criteria are not all contemporary, so it is important to look for them during the history-taking interview. A high level of irritability is almost constant in infants and young children. Other organ disorders may be associated (systemic vasculitis): cardiac (myocarditis, pericarditis), hepatobiliary (hepatitis, hydrocholecyst), neurological (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis), pulmonary, ocular (uveitis), or digestive.

**Incomplete Form**

There are incomplete forms (fewer than 4 major criteria), which can lead to misdiagnosis, particularly in younger children, exposing them to a greater risk of cardiac complications. In the presence of unexplained fever lasting more than 5 days, with a patient in poor general condition, it is important to investigate this diagnosis (in addition to the infectious work-up) by means of a biological work-up and cardiac ultrasound. A normal cardiac ultrasound does not rule out the diagnosis, but in the case of coronary dilatation, the diagnosis may be accepted even if there are fewer than 4 other major criteria other than fever.

**Biological Abnormalities**

The following anomalies are often observed:
- Inflammatory syndrome: high CRP and SV, hyperleukocytosis, thrombocytosis (appearing later, around day 10), hypoalbuminemia.
- Liver abnormality: moderate cytolysis (frequent), more rarely elevated bilirubin.
- Very frequent aseptic leucocyturia.
- Aseptic meningitis (when lumbar puncture is performed).

**Complications**

- Acute: Multisystemic form ""Kawasaki shock"" with myocarditis, multivisceral damage, macrophagic activation syndrome.
- Sub-acute: Dilatation of the coronary arteries, which may lead to aneurysm. The risk of dilatation is increased after 10 days without treatment, so the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is urgent. Diagnosis is made using a transthoracic cardiac ultrasound by a cardiologist experienced with this disease.

**Care/Orientation**

Suspicion of Kawasaki disease warrants a hospital assessment. Once the diagnosis is made, treatment is always hospital-based and involves an infusion of intravenous polyvalent immunoglobulin and aspirin in anti-inflammatory and then anti-aggregating doses for a total period of 6 to 8 weeks. Cardiological monitoring with ultrasound must be implemented.",0.75,14.177894736842106,False,True,0.7627414464950562,0.989743709564209,c,False,3,4

- The search for false hyperkalaemia
- Assessment of potassium intake
- Looking for obvious causes of transfer from the intracellular to the extracellular sector
- Looking for cell lysis
- Measurement of kaliuresis
- Search for factors favoring hyperkalaemia

**Hyperkalaemia May Be Linked To:**

- Excess intake in the case of renal failure
- Exaggerated transfer from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment
- Reduced renal excretion capacity

**Main Causes of Hyperkalaemia:**

- **Excess Intake:**
  - PO potassium chloride intake (++ if renal insufficiency)

- **Hyperkalaemia Transfer:**
  - Metabolic acidosis with normal plasma anion gap (++)
  - Cell catabolism (cell lysis):
    - Rhabdomyolysis and muscle crushing
    - Extensive burns, massive haemolysis
    - Spontaneous tumour lysis or lysis during chemotherapy
    - Post-operative revascularisation syndrome
    - Severe digestive haemorrhage
    - Hyperthermia
    - Intense physical exercise
    - Drug causes (++): Œ≤-blockers, digitalis intoxication

- **Reduced Renal Excretion (¬± Resistance to Action of Aldosterone):**
  - Acute and chronic renal failure (++)
  - Mineralocorticoid deficiency:
    - Adrenal insufficiency
    - Hyporeninism-hypoaldosteronism (diabetes)
  - Iatrogenic causes (most frequent) ++:
    - Antialdosterone (spironolactone) or amiloride
    - RAS blockers: ACE inhibitors, ARB2, Direct renin inhibitor
    - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
    - Ciclosporin, tacrolimus
    - Blocking the epithelial sodium channel: potassium-sparing diuretic (amiloride), trimethoprim, pentamidine

Overall, the most frequent causes of hyperkalaemia remain iatrogenic and are related to the use of ACE inhibitors or ARB2, most often in patients with effective hypovolaemia (extracellular dehydration, heart failure) or underlying chronic renal failure. Excessive potassium intake (diet salts or supplements) should also be investigated.",0.5714285714285714,13.063333333333333,False,True,0.7996127605438232,0.5360312561194102,c,False,3,4

**Description:** Left heart failure: flow, ejection fraction, remodeling, desynchronization, arrhythmias; right heart failure: knowing that right heart failure is in most cases linked to left heart failure, knowing the consequences of pulmonary hypertension and systemic venous hypertension.

== Left Heart Failure ==

**Definition:** Heart failure in which the primary damage is to the left ventricle.

### Determinants of Cardiac Output:

- **End-diastolic volume (EDV):** Volume of blood contained in the ventricles at the end of ventricular diastole (160 ml) = pre-load volume.
- **Telesystolic volume (TSV):** Volume of blood contained in the ventricles at the end of each systole (60 ml) = afterload volume.
- **Systolic ejection volume (SEV):** Volume of blood ejected from the heart by the ventricles during each contraction (100 ml) SEV = STEV - STV
- **LVEF ejection fraction (%):** (STV-TSV)/STV
- **Heart rate (Fc):** Expressed in beats per minute (average = 60 - 70 beats/min).
- **Cardiac output (Qc):** Volume of blood expelled by each ventricle per unit of time, expressed in liters per minute Qc = VES x Fc (average Qc = 5 l/min)

The systolic ejection volume depends on:

- **Intrinsic cardiac properties:** Inotropy and compliance. These properties are altered in heart failure.
- **Ventricular loading conditions:** Preload corresponds to ventricular filling conditions in diastole. Afterload corresponds to ventricular ejection conditions in systole.

The pressure-volume curve shows the main intrinsic properties of the heart (inotropy, compliance) and their effects on the systolic ejection volume (SEV) as a function of load conditions. The effect of heart failure by alteration of inotropy or compliance is represented on the hatched lines.

### Remodeling

- **Definition:** A consequence of cardiac damage, it is a set of changes in genomic expression leading to molecular, cellular, and interstitial changes which manifest clinically as changes in the size, shape, and function of the heart.
- This remodeling is present regardless of the cause of the heart attack. It results in a short-term increase in inotropy or cardiac ejection volume. In the long term, however, it is associated with an alteration in ventricular geometry and function. It involves several phenomena: neurohormonal activation, altered calcium and mitochondrial metabolism, interstitial fibrosis, hypertrophy, and cell death.

### Desynchronization and Arrhythmia

**Background:** Heart failure is accompanied by frequent changes in cardiac electrical activation; it is rare for a heart failure patient to have a strictly normal ECG.

- **Desynchronization:** Electrical disorders of ventricular activation (first-degree AV block, left bundle branch block) with hemodynamic consequences (shorter duration of diastole in the cardiac cycle, delayed contraction of the lateral wall on the septal wall in systole). This desynchronization can be corrected by specific stimulation techniques such as resynchronization.
- **Arrhythmias:** All the changes encountered in heart failure (alteration of the ventricular substrate, neurohormonal activation, presence of electrical triggers) favor the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias (extrasystoles, tachycardias, fibrillation). These arrhythmias can be poorly tolerated and lead to sudden death. They can be prevented in cases of severe heart failure by installing a defibrillation system.

== Right Heart Failure ==

Right heart failure may be secondary to intrinsic damage to the right ventricle or to an increase in right ventricular afterload due to precapillary pulmonary hypertension or postcapillary pulmonary hypertension itself linked to left heart failure (the most frequent cause). The consequences of this right heart failure will be:

- **Remodeling of the right ventricle:** Hypertrophy, dilatation, and dysfunction.
- **Clinical signs of right heart failure:** Edema of the lower limbs, jugular turgidity with ascites, and hepatocellular insufficiency in the late stages.

**Description:** None

The therapeutic strategy for non-insulin-dependent diabetes (mainly type 2 diabetes) is evolving rapidly, and HAS proposals are pending at the time of writing (December 2021).

The following classes of anti-diabetic treatments are currently available in France:

- **Biguanides:** Only representative, metformin. Active on the liver, reduces hepatic glucose production, particularly hepatic gluconeogenesis (uncertain effect on the intestine). Frequent digestive side effects. Short half-life, unchanged renal elimination, therefore accumulates in renal failure: need to reduce doses, and formal contraindication for a GFR <30 ml/min. Contraindicated in situations with spontaneous risk of lactic acidosis.

- **Hypoglycaemic Sulphonamides (Sulphonylureas):** Several representatives (gliclazide, glimepiride, etc.). They are associated with glinides (repaglinide) which have the same mechanism of action. Trigger insulin secretion, so inactive in the absence of pancreatic beta cells. Major risks: hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Metabolism and pharmacokinetics vary depending on the molecule and therefore require variable adjustment of dosage to renal function for hypoglycaemic sulphonamides. No contraindication for glinides even for end-stage renal failure.

- **Dipeptidyl-Peptidase 4 Inhibitors (DPP4, ""Gliptins""):** Several representatives (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, etc.). By inhibiting DPP4, they modestly increase circulating concentrations of incretins (GLP1 and GIP) and therefore increase insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion. No effect on weight, no effect on gastric emptying. Rare adverse effects (bullous pemphigoid). Posology to be adjusted to renal function. Modest therapeutic effect. No hypoglycaemia.

- **GLP1 Receptor Agonists (GLP1 Agonists):** Several representatives (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide). Injection. Have the same action as the natural hormone GLP1: amplify insulin secretion, slow down glucagon secretion. Early satiety, slower gastric emptying. Digestive side effects, start with increasing dosage. Weight loss, no hypoglycaemia. Variable pharmacology, all injectable, daily or weekly. Beneficial effect on cardiovascular prognosis.

- **Intestinal Alphaglucosidase Inhibitor:** Only representative: acarbose. It slows the end of digestion of complex carbohydrates, delays their intestinal absorption. Frequent digestive side effects. No effect on weight. Modest therapeutic effect.

- **SGLT2 Inhibitors:** Several types (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, etc.). Inhibit glucose reabsorption by the proximal convoluted tubule, thus induce glucosuria and natriuresis. Beneficial effect on heart failure and chronic kidney disease, including in non-diabetic subjects. Weight loss, reduction in blood pressure. Adverse effects: risk of genital infection, dehydration, ketoacidosis, uncertainty about an increased risk of amputation.

The oculomotor nerves originate in the brain stem, travel in the subarachnoid cisterns, then in the cavernous sinus, and end in the orbit on the oculomotor muscles. The medial longitudinal bundle (formerly medial longitudinal band) connects the nuclei of the IV and VI.

== Definitions ==

### Actual Origin of the Oculomotor Nerves

The motor neurons of the oculomotor nerves arise from nuclei located in the midbrain, at the level of the superior colliculus (oculomotor nucleus, origin of the somatomotor fibers of III) and inferior colliculus (nucleus of the trochlear nerve), and from the floor of the 4th ventricle to the bridge (abducens nerve nucleus).

### Cisternal Course of the Oculomotor Nerves

Nerves III, IV, and VI emerge at the surface of the brain stem (apparent origin) and travel in the subarachnoid cisterns:
- The oculomotor nerve (III) arises from the inter-peduncular fossa and travels between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries, then close to the posterior communicating artery to reach the roof of the cavernous sinus.
- The trochlear nerve (IV) arises from the dorsal aspect of the brain stem, follows the superior cerebellar artery and the tentorial incisure to reach the posterior part of the roof of the cavernous sinus.
- The abducens nerve (VI) arises in the pontomedullary sulcus and travels towards the dorsal surface of the clivus, where it pierces the dura mater. It then travels through a dural split to reach the posterior part of the cavernous sinus.

### Intra-Cavernous Course of the Cranial Nerves and in the Superior Orbital Fissure

The oculomotor (III) and trochlear (IV) nerves run in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, accompanied by the ophthalmic nerve (V1). The lower limit of the cavernous sinus passes through the upper border of the maxillary nerve (V2). The abducens nerve (VI) runs in the cavernous sinus, in contact with the lateral border of the internal carotid artery. They all enter the orbit via the superior orbital fissure.

### Oculomotor Muscles

The 4 rectus muscles attach to the sclera anterior to the equator, forming a cone and converging posteriorly on a densification of the optic nerve sheath (ring of tendons). The oblique muscles are inserted behind the equatorial plane and run obliquely. The isolated action of these muscles is shown, as is their innervation by the oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), and abducens (VI) nerves.

### Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus (FLM)

The FLM, located paramedian to the floor of the 4th ventricle, connects the nucleus VI to the contralateral nucleus III: abduction of one eye automatically induces adduction of the contralateral eye. A unilateral lesion of the FLM induces horizontal diplopia due to a lack of these conjugated movements (internuclear ophthalmoplegia).",0.25,13.372727272727271,False,True,0.7739412784576416,0.757459839185079,c,False,4,4

Epidemiology of Cystic Fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, also known as mucoviscidosis, is the most common serious genetic disease among children of European descent. It is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, affecting one in every 4,700 births. Approximately one in 35 individuals is a heterozygous carrier of a CFTR gene mutation. The most common mutation in France is F508del. Life expectancy at birth exceeds 40 years.

**Situations at Risk of Fetal Cystic Fibrosis**

- **Ultrasound Monitoring**

  The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be considered during pregnancy ultrasound monitoring if a hyperechoic bowel is observed. This is a non-specific warning sign that may indicate cystic fibrosis in about 5% of cases. The risk increases if the hyperechoic bowel is accompanied by the absence of gallbladder visualization. A study of the CFTR gene is then conducted in the couple. If mutations are detected in one or both partners, the fetus is tested for these mutations using an amniotic fluid sample.

- **Family History of Cystic Fibrosis**

  Both parents are heterozygous carriers of a CFTR mutation. The risk of transmitting the disease to offspring is 1/4 with each pregnancy. Prenatal diagnosis is possible via chorionic villus sampling from 11 weeks of amenorrhea or by amniocentesis from 16 weeks of amenorrhea. Once fetal DNA is extracted, molecular biology techniques determine the presence or absence of parental CFTR gene mutations. A pre-implantation diagnosis may also be proposed. If heterozygous status is known for only one parent, a comprehensive study of the CFTR gene is required for the other spouse to assess the risk.

- **One Parent Has Cystic Fibrosis**

  A parent with cystic fibrosis will pass on one of the two mutations they carry. It is necessary to determine the spouse's status by conducting a thorough study of the CFTR gene. If the spouse is heterozygous, the risk of transmitting the disease is 1/2, and prenatal or pre-implantation diagnosis is proposed.",1.0,16.053636363636368,False,True,0.7898449301719666,0.6561908721923828,c,True,2,4

- Psychomotor retardation
- Intellectual disability
- Sleep disorders, with almost 50% experiencing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
- Digestive malformations: anal imperforation, duodenal stenosis
- Hypoacusis/Deafness to be detected
- Risk of congenital cataract (1%)
- Attention deficit, impulsivity, intolerance to frustration
- Autism spectrum disorders in 5-10% of patients
- Epilepsy (West syndrome) in 5% of patients
- Recurring ENT infections
- Facial dysmorphia: microcephaly, flat profile; palpebral slits oblique upwards and outwards; small, round ear pavilions; flat neck with excess skin; joint and skin hyperlaxity; brachymesophalangia of the 5th fingers: clinodactyly; single transverse palmar crease (2/3 of cases); increased spacing between the first and second toes with wrinkled soles.
- Delayed growth in height and weight
- Flat feet with frequent valgus
- Hyperlaxity with possible C1/C2 instability
- Language delay

**At Birth:**

Examination of the Newborn

- Announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family
- Look for heart disease.
- Assessment of hypotonia

Contact

- Look for eating difficulties with swallowing problems (oral disorders that may require rehabilitation by a speech therapist).
- Identifying regurgitation (gastro-oesophageal reflux), which is more frequent in infants with trisomy 21
- Ask about transit disorders: constipation is frequent
- Monitoring weight gain: weight and height growth retardation is frequent (often over -2 SD)

Screening

- Hearing loss or deafness (PEAP currently used routinely)
- Congenital cataract, strabismus, nystagmus more frequent in children with trisomy 21 (Vision anomaly)

**In Infants:**

- Monitoring diet and growth in height and weight. How to look for coeliac disease
- Breast-feeding possible but often more difficult (oral disorders).
- Search for signs of West syndrome (convulsions)

**In Children:**

- Assess the extent of the psychomotor delay (psychomotor development abnormality)
- Assess the extent of language delay (language and/or phonation disorders)
- Assess the extent of cognitive delay (consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders)
- Suggest hygienic and dietary measures to combat the onset of obesity
- Research into oral disorders
- Screen for otorrhoea (frequent ENT infection), serous otitis
- Look for clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism: prescribe a TSHus and T4l every year (Thyroid work-up analysis). If dysthyroidism, ask for an antibody assay (anti-thyroglobulin).
- Look for hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly. Signs in favor of acute leukemia: 10 times more frequent in children with trisomy 21.
- Check the platelet count every year or every 2 years for frequent abnormalities of the haemogram, particularly lymphopenia and thrombocytosis, more rarely thrombocytopenia. It can also be used to diagnose acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
- In the event of neurological signs, a radiological examination should be ordered to look for C1/C2 instability with signs of spinal cord compression (MRI recommended rather than X-rays). Similarly, because of the hyperlaxity, there is a greater risk of valgus flat feet and dislocation of the patellas.
- Look for autism spectrum disorders, which are slightly more common in children with Down's syndrome (behavioral disorders in children and adolescents).
- Knowing how to look for sleep disorders, insomnia, or hypersomnia. It is estimated that almost 50% of children with Down's syndrome have obstructive sleep apnea.
- Children with Down's syndrome are more prone to autoimmune problems: thyroiditis, diabetes, alopecia, and hair loss.

**At the Paraclinical Level:**

Prescribe rehabilitation treatments:

- Physiotherapy from 2-3 months
- Speech therapy from birth in the case of oral disorders or around 9 months of age
- Psychomotricity around 1-2 years
- Occupational therapy depending on progress
- Psychological follow-up if necessary

Respiratory allergy in children results from the pressure of an environment against a predisposed genetic background (polygenic disease). In France today, 10% of children are asthmatic. This risk increases when one of the two parents is asthmatic (25% of asthmatic children in this case), and to more than 50% if both parents are asthmatic.

The main triggers in childhood asthma are primarily:

- Viral infections
- Allergy to pneumallergens (the same as in adults)

There are other clearly identified factors that trigger asthma in children:

- Exposure to tobacco from conception
- Indoor air pollution and atmospheric pollution

Suicidal ideas and intentions are possible from the age of 5-6. Suicidal thoughts are less frequent than in adolescents. The main methods used are hanging/strangulation and defenestration.

**Specific Clinical Signs:**  
How suicidal ideas are expressed depends on the child's developmental level.

- Aspecific signs of distress: externalized manifestations (irritability, unusual agitation, tantrums), internalized manifestations (withdrawal, isolation), developmental regressions (e.g., secondary enuresis), pain, functional signs, and a drop in school performance.
- More specific signs of suicidal crisis: endangerment, exaggerated preoccupation with death.

**Specific Risk Factors:**  

- Personal Factors:
  - Personal history of suicidal thoughts.
  - Personal psychiatric disorders (particularly depressive disorders, behavioral disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and ASD).
  - Emotional isolation.
  - Emotional dysregulation (particularly in the context of impulsivity).
  - Chronic illness or disability.

- Family Factors, Life Events, and Psychosocial Factors:
  - A family history of suicidal thoughts.
  - Family conflicts and parent-child interaction problems.
  - Experiences of abuse and neglect.
  - Harassment.
  - Psychiatric and/or substance use disorders in a parent.
  - Placement in an institutional setting (children in the care of social services).
  - Belonging to a cultural or sexual minority.

Family support is a major factor in protecting children from suicidal crises.

== Adolescents ==  
Do not trivialize thoughts of suicide. Requires intervention and prevention. The most frequent form is deliberate drug intoxication.

**Specific Clinical Signs:**  
How suicidal ideas are expressed depends on the adolescent's developmental level. The suicidal crisis may occur in the context of a drop in school results, an attraction to marginality, and risky behavior (substance use, risky sexual behavior, self-inflicted injuries, anorexia or bulimia, and endangerment on the public highway).

**Specific Risk Factors:**  
In addition to the risk factors linked to clinical and environmental characteristics detailed in the previous section on suicidal crisis in children, additional factors include dropping out of school and romantic break-ups. As in the case of children, family support is a major factor in protecting adolescents from suicidal crises.

== Adult ==  
Suicidal ideation is rarely expressed or overt. Manifestations of crisis include boredom, feelings of loss of role, uselessness, failure, injustice, being out of step, loss of investment in work, relationship difficulties, difficulties with the hierarchy, repeated work stoppages or over-investment in work, and repeated visits to the doctor because of aspecific symptoms (pain, feeling tired, etc.).

**Vulnerability Factors:**  
Precarious marital, social, or professional situations, conflict at work or professional harassment, an addictive disorder, psychiatric disorders, disabling, chronic, painful, or serious general medical conditions, situations of violence, narcissistic injury, immigration.

== Elderly Person ==  
Suicidal thoughts are rarely expressed. Risk of trivialization. Atypical manifestations of the crisis include withdrawal, refusal to eat, lack of communication, loss of interest in activities, and refusal of care.

**Vulnerability Factors:**  
Characterized depressive episode almost always found, other psychiatric disorders (particularly alcohol use disorder and personality disorders), disabling general medical conditions, pain, social isolation, conflicts, abuse, change of environment, widowhood.

== Suicidal Crisis in a Psychopathological Context ==  
Suicidal ideation is often easily expressed. Psychiatric disorders are major risk factors for suicide. Always assess patients suffering from psychiatric disorders.

**Warning Signs of Increased Suicidal Risk:**  
- Isolation with a decision to break off usual contact.
- Reduction or cessation of usual activities.
- Increased psychiatric symptoms.",1.0,8.756666666666668,False,True,0.713627815246582,0.530568540096283,c,False,2,3

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**

The concentration of ionised calcium is regulated by two circulating factors: parathyroid hormone (PTH) and active vitamin D (calcitriol). The secretion of PTH by the parathyroid glands depends on whether the calcium-sensitive receptor expressed on the membrane of their cells is stimulated. Stimulation of the receptor slows down the secretion of PTH. PTH acts by mobilising calcium from the bone mineral phase and increasing tubular reabsorption of calcium in the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule. PTH inhibits phosphate reabsorption and stimulates calcitriol synthesis in the proximal tubule. Calcitriol, an active metabolite of vitamin D, increases the digestive absorption of calcium and phosphorus.

**Mechanisms of Hypocalcaemia**

Hypocalcaemia occurs when the net loss of calcium from the extracellular compartment exceeds the calcium intake from the intestine or bone. Hypocalcaemia therefore results from:

- An increase in calcium losses (deposits in tissues, bone transfer, urinary losses, intravascular chelation)
- A reduction in calcium entering the circulation (intestinal malabsorption, reduced bone resorption)",0.875,14.177894736842106,False,True,0.7982656955718994,0.7961423993110657,b,False,3,3

Medical ethics encompass the duties of doctors towards patients, other professionals, and society. The Code of Medical Ethics serves as a reference for the jurisdictional bodies of the Ordre des M√©decins.

**Definition**

The term ""deontology"" first appeared in French in 1825, in a translation of the work of the English utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham entitled ""Essai sur la nomenclature et la classification des principales branches d'Art et Science"".

In medicine, professional ethics serve as a reference for the legal bodies of the Ordre des M√©decins and as a guide for doctors in their daily practice, in the service of patients.

The Code of Medical Ethics is not solely drafted by the profession. While the Ordre National des M√©decins is responsible for drafting it, the text is submitted to the administration, the Conseil d'Etat, and the government for compliance checks with laws and regulations. Amendments may be made, and the code is published in the Journal Officiel under the Prime Minister's signature.

The Code of Ethics outlines the regulatory provisions governing professional practice. These provisions are subordinate to more important texts, such as the Constitution and laws, and must be compatible with other decrees. Doctors, like other citizens, are subject to the law, including respect for life and professional secrecy, but their professional body is governed by its own rules.

- **In practice:**
  - Any sudden headache should be investigated as an aneurysmal SAH.
  - Any progressive headache should be investigated as HTIC.
  - Any febrile headache should be investigated as meningitis.
  - Investigations are carried out in the emergency department, sometimes after the patient has been transferred to a center with the necessary imaging capabilities (angioscanner).

**1. Imaging for acute headache**  
- Request for an imaging examination (SD-231); reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination (SD-178); discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination (SD-226)

- **Cerebral CT scan as a matter of urgency:** Any sudden headache should be investigated by a cerebral CT scan without injection to look for a SAH, whenever possible with a cerebral angioscan immediately.
- **In the presence of a visible SAH:** The search for an aneurysm indicates a cerebral angioscanner if this has not already been done.
- **In the absence of a visible SAH:** LP is imperative.
- If no SAH is found on CT scan or LP, the search for another cause must be discussed (specialist opinion), particularly if the headache persists, and is based on arterial (SVCR), venous (TVC), and SAH (dissection) angioscanner, followed by cerebral MRI (TVC, pituitary necrosis).
  - **ASD angioscan** must be performed for any suspected dissection (cervicalgia, Claude-Bernard-Horner, sudden headache without visible ASD).
- Imaging will be repeated a few days later (MRI+MRA or angioscan) in cases of suspected CRS with normal initial parenchymal and arterial imaging.
- After an angioscan and LP showing no aneurysmal SAH, cerebral arteriography via the femoral route is not useful.

**2. Imaging for acute progressive headache**  
- Cerebral imaging is necessary in all cases, with a variable delay
  - Headache present or aggravated for < 7 days: emergency imaging.
  - Stable headache for > 7 days: delays to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
- A full brain MRI is ideally performed immediately (T1, FLAIR, injected T1, and vascular sequences) to look for an intracranial expansive process (mass, contrast) and signs of CVT. A T2* sequence may be requested to identify bleeding or a hyposignal CVT. A fat-sat sequence (fat saturation) and MRA of the ASD are required to detect a cervical arterial dissection.
- If access to MRI is limited, a brain scan without and then with injection of contrast medium and an angioscan of the ASD will be performed. If there is no diagnosis after the scan and the headache persists, an MRI scan should be performed to look for lesions that are not easily visible on the scan (CVT, PRES, pituitary necrosis, and intracranial hypotension).
- If imaging does not provide a definitive diagnosis and the headache persists, an LP should be discussed to look for meningitis or a CSF pressure disorder.

**3. Imaging for chronic headache (long-standing and habitual)**  
Carry out a cerebral MRI scan (avoid non-emergency scans as they can cause radiation) only if there is a suspicion of a secondary headache and/or a neurological disease that can cause auras (other than migraine).

- Migraine attacks starting after the age of 50
- Atypical migraine aura because of abrupt onset, duration > 60 minutes, symptoms always on the same side, or absence of visual disturbance
- Chronic migraine for less than a year
- Chronic tension headache for less than a year
- Algie vasculaire de la face (AVF) at least once (rule out AVF secondary to damage to the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, or posterior fossa)
- Abnormal clinical examination

**Paediatric particularities:**  
- Request for a patient's explanation of the procedure, risks, and expected benefits of an imaging examination (SD-232)
- The indication for brain imaging must be justified because: 
  - Brain MRI requires sedation or general anesthesia until the child is old enough to remain calm (7-8 years).
  - Radiation exposure in children must be kept to a minimum.
- The indications for emergency brain imaging are: abnormal neurological examination; changes in headache; signs of HTIC; visual or oculomotor disorders; persistent or increasing frequency of vomiting; signs suggestive of hypothalamic-pituitary damage; delay or change in height.",1.0,19.176000000000005,False,True,0.8301501274108887,0.7056232889493307,b,False,4,3

**Title:** Know a Few of the Most Common Rare Diseases  
**Description:** Item 45 deals with Trisomy 21, Fragile X syndrome, and cystic fibrosis. In this rare diseases item, briefly mention the rare diseases that may be encountered in the career of a general practitioner, in particular haemochromatosis, haemophilia, sickle cell anaemia, thalassaemia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The aim is not to cover all these diseases, but to understand how common they are, the huge diversity of clinical pathways, and the need for multidisciplinary follow-up of patients.  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

**Haemochromatosis:** A genetic disease caused by excessive intestinal absorption of iron, most often linked to a deficiency in the production of hepcidin, the systemic iron-regulating hormone, and more rarely to hepcidino-resistance. As a result, iron is deposited in various organs such as the liver, pancreas, and heart. Haemochromatosis can lead to chronic fatigue (""Abnormal genital bleeding (SD-112)""), melanoderma, and liver damage (""Hepatomegaly (SD-006)"") (cirrhosis with a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma), diabetes mellitus, arthropathy, (""Joint pain (SD-067)""), osteoporosis, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, or heart failure. Biochemical abnormalities include elevated transferrin saturation coefficient (reflecting hyperabsorption of iron, and therefore very early onset) and elevated serum ferritin (reflecting visceral iron overload, and therefore secondary onset) (""Ferritin: decrease or increase (SD-207)""). Haemochromatosis linked to the ""HFE"" gene, by far the most common form, is a frequent disease, with around 1 in 200 Caucasians carrying the genetic predisposition (homozygous ""HFE"" C282Y mutation). Its penetrance (probability of expressing the disease) is incomplete and its expressivity (nature of the symptoms presented) variable. Haemochromatosis is as common in men as in women, but is more marked in men. There are rare forms of haemochromatosis that are not linked to the HFE gene. These forms are not exclusive to Caucasian populations; they are often more severe and earlier-onset (they occur before the age of 30 and are sometimes called juvenile haemochromatosis). Haemochromatosis, which may or may not be linked to the HFE gene, is autosomal recessive, except in the exceptional case of hepcidino-resistance (dominant disease).

**Haemophilia:** X-linked genetic disease characterised by spontaneous or prolonged haemorrhage due to a deficiency in factor VIII (haemophilia A, gene ""F8"") or IX (haemophilia B, gene ""F9"") (""Bleeding tendency (SD-059)"", ""Acute haemorrhage (SD-060)""). The annual incidence is 1 in 5000 male births and the prevalence in the population is estimated at 1/12,000. Haemorrhage usually starts when the child learns to walk. The severity of clinical manifestations depends on the severity of the coagulation factor deficiency: if the biological activity of the coagulation factor is less than 1%, haemophilia is severe. If it is between 1 and 5%, haemophilia is moderate. If it is between 5 and 40%, the haemophilia is minor. Bleeding can occur at any site following trauma, most often in the joints (haemarthrosis) (""Joint pain (SD-067)"") and muscles (""Purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma (SD-089)""). To compensate for factor VIII or IX deficiency, a replacement therapy is used, the aim of which is to supply the missing factor to the body: recombinant antihaemophilic factor. It can be administered following a haemorrhage (treatment on demand) or to prevent bleeding (prophylactic treatment). Haemophilia A and B are haemorrhagic diseases, the management of which is the responsibility of the patient's therapeutic education. The most frequent complication is the appearance of antibodies directed against the infused coagulation factor, inhibiting its action (known as inhibitory antibodies). Surgical corrections, particularly orthopaedic, are possible in specialised centres.

**Sickle Cell Anaemia:** A frequent autosomal recessive genetic disease (around 270 new cases per year in the Ile-de-France region, 400 new cases per year in France), which is serious and mainly affects people of sub-Saharan African and West Indian origin. The prevalence of heterozygotes in Europe is estimated at around 1/150: in Central and West Africa (15-25%), in the American overseas departments (10-12%) and in the Mediterranean regions (1-15%), a high prevalence is observed in areas that are or have been affected by malaria, as this anomaly offers protection against neuromalaria. Sickle cell disease is caused by an abnormality in the haemoglobin (""HBB"" gene) which results in the deformation of red blood cells, causing them to lose their rounded shape (false shape). Sickle cell anaemia is a chronic haemolytic disease predisposing to 3 types of acute complications: severe anaemia (""Childhood pallor (SD-055)"", ""Decreased haemoglobin (SD-217)""), severe bacterial infections, and ischaemic vaso-occlusive accidents (AVO) secondary to conflicts between the small vessels and the red blood cells which are not sufficiently deformable. Various organic complications may also arise. Management must include the prevention of infections, pain (""Assessment and management of acute pain (SD-259)"", ""Assessment and management of chronic pain (SDD-260)"", ""Assessment and management of pain in children and infants (SD-261)"") and any complications, as well as the social and psycho-educational dimension, within multidisciplinary centres equipped with intensive care (immediate access to blood transfusion). Occasional or scheduled transfusion remains an essential therapeutic modality (""Prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion (SD-272)""). The main indication for bone marrow transplantation is the presence of cerebral vasculopathy. Some children with severe sickle cell disease may require intensified treatment: hydroxycarbamide, transfusion programme, haematopoietic stem cell transplant, gene therapy. Systematic neonatal screening is offered to at-risk populations.

**Thalassaemias:** Genetic disorders, most often autosomal recessive, which result in a reduction in the synthesis of globin chains, either alpha (alpha-thalassaemias, ""HBA1"" and ""HBA2"" genes) or beta (beta-thalassaemias, ""HBB"" gene). The imbalance in synthesis between alpha and non-alpha chains causes precipitation of unpaired chains, inefficient erythropoiesis, and anaemia (""Child pallor (SD-055)"", ""Haemoglobin decrease (SD-217)""). Depending on the degree of anaemia and transfusion requirements, a distinction is made between intermediate thalassaemias with moderate transfusion requirements and major thalassaemias for which regular transfusions are vital (""Prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion (SD-272)""). The prognosis for these forms has been improved by transfusion programmes and iron chelation; given the complexity of the treatment, children are offered a bone marrow transplant with an HLA-compatible related donor.

**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD):** X-linked disease characterised by progressive atrophy and ""Muscular weakness (SD-074)"" due to degeneration of the skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles. DMD mainly affects boys, and the prevalence of male births is between 1/3,500 and 1/9,300. Muscle damage is caused by the complete absence of dystrophin, due to variants in the ""DMD"" gene. The disease begins in early childhood, and affected boys may present with neurodevelopmental disorders (after the age of 18 months), language disorders, and/or a delay in overall development (""Psychomotor Developmental Anomaly (SD-115)""). Autism and behavioural problems are relatively common. The disease progresses rapidly and the child develops a ""waddling"" gait and has a positive Gowers sign. Loss of walking occurs between the ages of 6 and 13, with an average of 9.5 years in patients not treated with steroids. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of the clinical picture, family history, and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels 100 to 200 times higher than normal. Genetic analysis is the reference method. Although the situation is improving thanks to advances in multidisciplinary management and treatment, the prognosis for DMD is severe and life expectancy is significantly reduced, with death occurring early in adulthood.",1.0,18.19909090909091,False,True,0.7308416366577148,0.6027570764223734,d,True,5,4

**Title:** Knowing the Different Social Security Schemes

**Description:** Knowledge

**Rubric:** Definition

The Social Security system consists of various schemes that group insured persons based on their professional activity:

- The general scheme covers 88% of the French population and includes most employees, students, recipients of certain benefits, and ordinary residents. Since January 1, 2018, social protection for the self-employed (RSI) has been integrated into the general Social Security scheme.

- The agricultural scheme, within the Mutualit√© Sociale Agricole (MSA), covers 5% of the French population and pertains to farmers and agricultural employees. It is a one-stop shop managing health insurance, occupational accidents and diseases, retirement, and family benefits. The MSA manages the collection of its contributions. The MSA logo is used to represent this scheme.

The special schemes predate the general scheme and opted not to join it in 1945. Although they existed before the creation of the Social Security system, they were maintained by the legislator in the decree of June 8, 1946, as outlined in articles L711-1 and R711-1 of the Social Security Code. These articles state that certain groups remain subject to a special social security organization if their members already benefit from a special scheme under one or more social security legislations:

- Administrations, services, offices, public establishments of the State, industrial establishments of the State, and the Imprimerie Nationale, for civil servants, magistrates, and workers of the State.
- Regions, d√©partements, and communes.
- Departmental and communal public establishments that are not of an industrial or commercial nature.
- Activities requiring membership of the French Seamen's Insurance Scheme established by the Decree-Law of June 17, 1938, as amended.
- Mining companies and companies treated as such, as defined by decree no 46-2769 of November 27, 1946, except for activities related to the exploration or exploitation of liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons.
- Soci√©t√© Nationale des Chemins de Fer Fran√ßais.
- Secondary general interest and local interest railways and tramways.
- The production, transport, and distribution of electricity and gas.
- The Banque de France.
- The Th√©√¢tre National de l'Op√©ra de Paris and the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise.

There are three main types of special schemes:

- The civil service scheme (civil servants and military personnel).
- The scheme for public companies and establishments.
- Other schemes, smaller in terms of the number of beneficiaries, which may be structured either on a professional basis (schemes for notary clerks and employees, mines, churches, etc.) or on a company basis (schemes for staff of the Paris Opera, RATP, SNCF).

The organization and operation of special schemes vary significantly. However, they are characterized by the fact that various risks (sickness, family, retirement, accidents at work, etc.) are covered differently by the companies or institutions themselves, by specific funds, or by the bodies of the General Scheme.

Since 1945, a dual phenomenon has been observed:

- A significant reduction in their number: while there were more than a hundred special schemes when Social Security was created in 1945, there were 27 in 2021, concentrated mainly in pension management, which explains the current challenges in reforming the pension system.
- A convergence with the R√©gime G√©n√©ral, both in operation and in the payment of benefits, which are increasingly aligned with it, particularly regarding retirement and health insurance.

Social and economic changes have led to major transformations in the economic sectors covered by the special schemes. Industrial sectors such as mining and tobacco have declined sharply, resulting in fewer workers and resources for these schemes. The deteriorating ratio between the number of contributors and beneficiaries poses a sustainability challenge for these schemes in the near or distant future.",0.8333333333333334,13.080000000000002,False,True,0.7486966848373413,0.6732605497042338,c,False,5,3

The diagnosis of Graves' disease should be clinically considered when there is an association of hyperthyroidism with orbitopathy (SFE 2016 consensus).

In the absence of orbitopathy, it is primarily based on the positive plasma dosage of anti-TSH receptor antibodies.

In the event of clinical suspicion of Graves' disease, if the concentration of TSH receptor antibodies is not high or if it is not possible to measure the antibodies in plasma, a thyroid scintigraphy should be performed as a second-line treatment. This shows diffuse and homogeneous hyperfixation of the isotope, characteristic of Graves' disease.

Thyroid ultrasound-doppler can be useful for diagnosis, as a complement to antibody assays or as an alternative to scintigraphy in the case of pregnancy, showing an overall hypoechoic gland with often diffuse hypervascularisation.",0.6666666666666666,14.64,False,True,0.7825018167495728,0.7124046484629313,c,False,2,4

**Title:** Knowing the Definition of Fault

**Rubric:** Definition

Since the law of 4 March 2002, doctors' professional obligations have been replaced by legally enshrined patients' rights. Patients may claim that one of their rights has been infringed to hold a doctor or healthcare establishment liable. However, the onus is on the patient to prove fault. Article L.1142-1 of the French Public Health Code stipulates that health professionals and establishments are only liable for the harmful consequences of preventive or therapeutic acts if they are at fault.

**Patients' Rights**

Infringement of one of these rights may give rise to medical liability for negligence:

- Right to health protection
- Right to respect for dignity
- Right not to be discriminated against in access to prevention or care
- Right to privacy and confidentiality of information
- Right to receive the most appropriate treatment and care and to benefit from therapies whose effectiveness is recognized and which guarantee the best possible health safety and relief of suffering in light of proven medical knowledge
- Right not to be subjected to acts of unreasonable obstinacy
- Right to deep and continuous sedation causing an alteration in consciousness maintained until death
- Right to receive treatment and care to relieve suffering
- Right of access to palliative care and support
- Right to be informed about your state of health
- Right to information on the costs to which the user may be exposed in the course of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic activities
- Right to refuse or not to receive treatment

The event giving rise to liability must therefore be a proven fault. This fault can take different forms and is usually distinguished as follows:

- Technical negligence, which consists of a breach of established medical knowledge or scientific data. This proven medical knowledge constitutes a technical standard to which the judge refers and may be defined by reference to scientific medical literature and recommendations of good practice. The judge must refer to proven medical knowledge at the time of the disputed medical act.
- Breach of a duty of humanism, which refers to the ""human"" dimension of medical practice, and may result in particular from a breach of professional secrecy or a lack of information that does not allow free and informed consent.

In some cases, the triggering event may take other forms: it may be the defect of a health product, the product being considered defective when it does not offer the safety that can legitimately be expected.",0.5625,17.90875,False,True,0.7461158037185669,0.8650429447491964,c,False,2,3

=== Ruptured Aneurysms ===  
These require immediate surgical intervention. The overall mortality rate is greater than 80%. Patients arriving at the hospital alive often have a rupture contained in the retroperitoneum. In such cases, a CT scan may be performed if haemodynamics allow. Mortality after surgery for ruptured aneurysms is approximately 30%.

=== Painful Aneurysms ===  
Patients with painful aneurysms must be rapidly admitted to the hospital for surgery. A CT scan is performed urgently, while simultaneously assessing the patient's general, cardiovascular, renal, and respiratory condition.

Acute ischaemia due to embolism from the aneurysm thrombus is rare. It requires immediate management through embolectomy. The aneurysm should be treated subsequently.

=== Aorto-Caval Fistula or Aorto-Digestive Fistula ===  
Aorto-caval and aorto-digestive fistulas occur when the aneurysm ruptures into a neighboring hollow organ, such as the inferior vena cava or the duodenum. Aorto-caval fistulas cause haemodynamic failure without deglobulation. Acute aorto-digestive fistula results in haemodynamic failure with digestive haemorrhage, which may present as haematemesis or rectal bleeding.

**Title:** Know how to diagnose metabolic acidosis associated with renal failure, diarrhea, lactic acidosis, and ketoacidosis.

**Description:** Understand the clinical context and the diagnostic value of the plasma anion gap.

**Rubric:** Diagnostic Approach

**1. First Step: Confirm Metabolic Acidosis**

- Acidosis: arterial blood pH < 7.38 (or venous pH < 7.32)
- Metabolic: HCO3 < 22 mmol/L (with secondary fall in PCO2 by ventilatory compensation)

**2. Second Step: Characterize Whether the Metabolic Acidosis is Simple, Mixed, or Complex**

- Simple: PaCO2 = expected PaCO2
- Mixed: PaCO2 > expected PaCO2
- Complex: PaCO2 < expected PaCO2

**3. Third Step: Determine the Plasma Anion Gap**

BP = [Na‚Å∫] + [K‚Å∫] - [Cl‚Åª + HCO3‚Åª] = 16 ¬± 4 mmol/L

Variations in BP help assess whether the anion accompanying the excess H‚Å∫ (and therefore the loss of HCO3‚Åª) is chlorine (the anion measured) or unmeasured anions.

- Acidosis with normal anion gap (HCl gain): renal or digestive loss of HCO3‚Åª leads to a decrease in HCO3‚Åª compensated by a proportional increase in Cl‚Åª (HCl gain), resulting in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
- Acidosis with high anion gap (BP > 20 mmol/L): addition of H‚Å∫ associated with an unmeasured anion (AH gain) leads to a drop in [HCO3‚Åª] replaced by an unmeasured anion (e.g., lactate).

**4. Diagnose Metabolic Acidosis with Increased Plasma Anion Gap**

- Lactic Acidosis (lactate assay): acidosis and BP secondary to lactic acid accumulation:
  - Shock with tissue hypoxia
  - Biguanide toxicity (in the event of overdose in renal failure)
- Ketoacidosis (determination of ketonemia; ketonuria by urine dipstick): acidosis and BP secondary to accumulation of ketoacids:
  - Diabetic ketoacidosis
  - Less common: alcoholic ketoacidosis, fasting ketoacidosis
- Severe Renal Failure (acute or chronic): acidosis secondary to the kidney's failure to eliminate H‚Å∫ ions and BP secondary to accumulation of anions not eliminated by the kidney (organic acids, phosphate ion, sulfate ion). The BP is not very high (< 26 mmol/L).
- Intoxication with an Exogenous Acid: acidosis and BP secondary to accumulation of the exogenous acid:
  - Salicylate, ethylene glycol, methanol

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**

Puberty is triggered by the hypothalamic reactivation of the GnRH (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone) pulsatility. GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone). The appearance of this pulsatility is modulated by neuroendocrine and peripheral factors, including leptin produced by adipose tissue, genetic and ethnic factors, nutritional status, and intercurrent pathologies.

- **In Boys:**  
  - FSH is responsible for the growth of testicular volume.  
  - LH stimulates the production of testosterone, which is responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics (penis, hair) and musculoskeletal changes.

- **In Girls:**  
  - LH and FSH lead to ovarian activation and the production of oestrogens.  
  - Oestrogens cause mammary, uterovaginal, and OGE development, followed by the appearance of the first menstrual periods (menarche).

Pubic hair development is linked to the production of gonadal and adrenal androgens.

The increase in sex hormones enhances the frequency and amplitude of growth hormone (GH) secretion peaks, accelerating the speed of statural growth (pubertal growth peak).",0.5714285714285714,18.675,False,True,0.7511909008026123,0.7083815336227417,b,True,4,3

**Title:** Unreasonable Obstinacy and Limitation: Legislative Framework, Philosophical and Ethical Foundations  
**Description:** Leonetti and Claeys-Leonetti laws. Definition of active care and management. Principle of double effect. Understanding unreasonable obstinacy and therapeutic prolongation, respecting patient wishes, relieving pain and suffering, sedation. Concepts of limiting and stopping treatment. Distinguishing between treatment and care. Definition of palliative care.

The L√©onetti law of 22 April 2005 on patients' rights and the end of life and the Claeys-L√©onetti law of 2 February 2016 aim to improve care for patients at the end of life. The focus is not on initiating or prolonging active therapies, but on withdrawing to maintain palliative care, which can include deep and continuous sedation until death. These laws provide a framework for stopping medical treatments that are disproportionate or only maintain vital functions, while preserving the patient's dignity.

These laws are part of a social and legal movement from the 1970s-1980s promoting patient autonomy, allowing patients to communicate their end-of-life wishes. Advances in medical technology now allow life to be prolonged even after patients lose the ability to express themselves. Around 70% of the French population die in hospital.

## The Right to Support at the End of Life and to Refuse Unreasonable Obstinacy

The Claeys-L√©onetti law states that everyone has the right to access palliative care and support at the end of life: ""Everyone has the right to a dignified end of life with the best possible relief of suffering. Healthcare professionals will ensure this right is respected. Everyone has the right to receive treatment and care designed to relieve their suffering.""

The law reaffirms the patient's right to refuse or interrupt treatment and prescribes the continuation of follow-up, particularly palliative care. If refusing or interrupting treatment endangers the patient's life, they must reiterate this decision within a reasonable time and may seek another medical opinion. The doctor must respect the patient's wishes after informing them of the consequences.

The 2016 law enshrines the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy: ""When treatments appear unnecessary, disproportionate, or only maintain life artificially, they may be suspended or not undertaken, in accordance with the patient's wishes or, if the patient is unable to express wishes, following a collegiate procedure.""

The law addresses two medical situations: limiting care and stopping care, both designed to avoid unreasonable obstinacy. Limiting care means refraining from measures likely to prolong a life in serious danger. Stopping care involves suspending vital treatment, such as artificial respiration.

The 2016 law confirmed that artificial nutrition and hydration are considered treatments and may be suspended if the patient has expressed a wish not to continue them. Patients should be reassured they will be comfortable and not feel thirsty or hungry.

For those unable to express themselves, no decision to limit treatment may be taken without a collegial procedure to ascertain the patient's wishes. This involves a meeting with healthcare professionals familiar with the situation and a second medical opinion. The doctor must consult the patient's advance directives or, failing that, the trusted support person or family. The doctor will decide whether to stop treatment, informed by the patient's wishes.

## The Right to Deep and Continuous Sedation

The Claeys-L√©onetti law affirms the right to deep and continuous sedation until death when the vital prognosis is short-term: ""At the patient's request to avoid suffering and unreasonable obstinacy, deep and continuous sedation causing altered consciousness until death, with analgesia and cessation of life-sustaining treatments, is possible in specified cases.""

A refractory symptom is unbearably perceptible and cannot be relieved despite efforts to find a suitable therapeutic protocol without compromising consciousness.

Deep and continuous sedation is based on the ""double effect argument"": ""The physician implements analgesic and sedative treatments to respond to refractory suffering, even if they may shorten life."" This distinguishes between acting and refraining from acting, and between acting and ceasing to act, based on the intentions of the agent. The intention to cause death, constituting ""active"" euthanasia, differs from refraining from continuing unnecessary or harmful treatment, known as ""therapeutic overkill,"" condemned by the principle of non-maleficence.

The distinction between euthanasia and non-euthanasia is based on the intended effect of an act versus its unintended side-effects. The ""double effect"" argument inspired the 2005 law on the end of life, revised in 2016. According to this argument, undesirable consequences of an action considered primarily ""good"" do not prevent that action. For example, relieving suffering at the end of life is possible even if intensive painkillers hasten death. The principle of double effect allows for prioritizing the primary good despite its evil effect, resolving moral conflicts between relieving suffering and protecting life.

## Respecting the Wishes of People at the End of Their Lives

The option for patients to write advance directives regarding their end-of-life wishes has existed since the 2005 law. The 2016 law made these directives binding.

The Claeys-L√©onetti law provides for advance directives and the designation of a trusted support person to recognize the rights of those unable to express their wishes. Advance directives express a person's wishes regarding end-of-life treatment and may be revised or revoked at any time.

Advance directives are binding on doctors, except in life-threatening emergencies or when directives appear inappropriate. Some stress the variability of wishes and the difficulty of interpreting directives drawn up in different circumstances. The decision to refuse to apply advance directives deemed inappropriate is taken at the end of a collegiate procedure and recorded in the medical record.

The ""trusted support person"" may be a relative, close friend, or treating doctor. Their testimony prevails over others. This designation is made in writing and co-signed by the designated person and may be reviewed and revoked at any time.

**Conclusion:** The refusal of unreasonable obstinacy limits the power to prolong life at the cost of suffering and disregarding the patient's wishes. The right to ensure wishes are respected through advance directives reinforces limits to this abuse. However, the end of life requires anticipation and resists it, marked by fear of the future and the hope of living serenely. End-of-life care involves offering adaptive, day-to-day support to live in the present without attempting to control the future.

**Title:** Know how to diagnose the removal of a prosthetic valve, including haemolysis  

**Definitions:**

There are two main causes of prosthesis deinsertion:

- Early onset: Loosening of the suture of the prosthesis or paravalvular leakage due to significant calcification.
- Medium- or long-term onset: Deleterious infective endocarditis, which should be systematically investigated.

The clinical picture varies, depending on the severity of the induced regurgitation and the speed at which it develops. Disinsertion may be completely asymptomatic or may progress to a state of cardiogenic shock.

**Physical Examination:**

- A regurgitant murmur is noted, diastolic at the aortic site for a prosthesis in the aortic position, and systolic at the mitral site for a prosthesis in the mitral position.

**Key Examinations:**

- The primary examination is Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE), generally supplemented by Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE).
- Colour Doppler can identify a paraprosthetic leak, i.e., a leak between the prosthesis and the native valve annulus.
- Ultrasound is used to quantify the leak and assess its impact, particularly on the left ventricle.

**Laboratory Tests:**

- Blood cultures should be taken systematically to avoid missing infective endocarditis.
- Biologically, there is generally a nonspecific inflammatory syndrome and sometimes haemolysis. In haemolysis, LDH is increased, and haptoglobin is reduced. The presence of schizocytes indicates the mechanical origin of the anaemia.

**Management:**

- If the deinsertion is moderate, stable, asymptomatic, and has no impact on the TTE, simple monitoring may suffice.
- In the event of complications, interventional or surgical management may be required.",1.0,13.470000000000002,False,True,0.782572865486145,0.6370475888252258,c,False,4,4

The most common primary intracranial tumours were described in the previous section. Other rarer histological subtypes include:

- **Neurinoma or Schwannoma:**
  - Develops from Schwann cells of the cranial/peripheral nerves (excluding the olfactory and optic nerves, which are extensions of the central nervous system).
  - Benign in the vast majority of cases.
  - Occurs sporadically or as part of neurofibromatosis type 2 (phacomatosis).
  - Preferential location: vestibular nerve.
  - MRI: Homogeneously enhanced tumour arising from the internal auditory canal (for vestibular schwannoma).

- **Ependymoma:**
  - Develops from ventricular ependymocytes.
  - Intraventricular location, often supraventricular in adults (unlike children).
  - Occurs mainly in children, sometimes in young adults.
  - MRI: Poly-lobulated morphology; intense enhancement after contrast injection.
  - Benign (WHO grade 1 or 2); more rarely malignant (WHO grade 3).

- **Medulloblastoma:**
  - Malignant embryonal tumour (WHO grade 4).
  - Infratentorial location: vermis of the cerebellum.
  - Occurs mainly in children, sometimes in young adults.
  - MRI: Heterogeneous enhancement after contrast injection.
  - Possible metastatic dissemination in the LCS; requires systematically injected panmedullary MRI.

- **Hemangioblastoma:**
  - Benign vascular tumour.
  - Occurs sporadically or as part of Von Hippel-Lindau disease (phacomatosis).
  - Preferential location in the cerebellum or spinal cord.
  - MRI: Mixed appearance, cystic/solid, with a strongly enhanced mural nodule after contrast injection.
  - Biology: Rarely, presence of secondary polycythaemia (secretion of erythropoietic factor by the tumour) is suggestive of diagnosis.

- **Primary Cerebral Lymphoma:**
  - Malignant lymphoma type B, diffuse, large cell.
  - Primitive: occurs in the absence of any other systemic location.
  - Rare, typically > 60 years.
  - Occurrence favoured by immunosuppression, e.g., HIV, organ transplantation.

**Title:** Knowing the major epidemiological trends in allergies to hymenoptera venoms: prevalence, mortality, etc.

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Epidemiology

**Definitions:**

Hymenoptera venoms (bees, wasps, hornets) contain:

- Vasoactive substances responsible for toxic reactions and non-allergic hypersensitivity.
- Enzymes and other proteins responsible for immediate immuno-allergic reactions mediated by venom allergen-specific IgE antibodies.

Bee stings occur mainly in spring and early summer, generally when the insect feels threatened. The sting remains in the skin, causing the bee's abdomen to rupture. The main allergen in the venom is phospholipase A2.

Wasps are more aggressive than bees and can sting for no apparent reason, sometimes several times because the sting does not stay in the skin. They sting until late autumn. Hyaluronidase, antigen 5, and phospholipase A1 are the three major allergens in the venom.

Hornets belong to the same family as wasps. Their stings are more painful, and the quantity of venom injected is greater. Allergic reactions are often crossed with wasp venom allergy (similar composition) and sometimes with bee venom (50% homology between phospholipase A2 from hornet venom and phospholipase A2 from bee venom).

**Prevalence of Hymenoptera Allergy:**

- 10 to 40% of the population is sensitized (not necessarily allergic; beekeepers, in particular, are very frequently sensitized and rarely allergic).
- 0.3 to 7.5% of the general population suffer systemic reactions, potentially causing severe anaphylaxis, with a low mortality rate (0.03 to 0.45/million population/year).",1.0,5.863636363636363,False,True,0.794623076915741,0.6140174468358358,c,False,2,3

**Description:** Knowing How to Define/Recognize  
**Rubric:** Definition

**Interaction:** Occurs when the association between an exposure and a health phenomenon varies according to the level of another factor, known as effect modification, called the interaction factor.

- The interaction factor must not be confused with a confounding factor: the presence of a confounding factor can produce (or amplify) the association under study even though it does not exist, or mask (or reduce) it when it does exist.
- To account for an interaction factor, we can perform:
  - A stratified analysis.
  - The introduction of an interaction term into a multivariate model.
- The interaction test is necessary to determine whether the effect is modified in a statistically significant way, i.e., whether there is a significant difference in the association between the levels of the interaction factor (the null hypothesis is the absence of interaction, the alternative hypothesis is the existence of an interaction).
- Example: Study evaluating the association between smoking and lung cancer (fictitious figures):

**Confounding Factor:**

- Men: RR = 2.67
- Women: RR = 2.05

Sex is a confounding factor here: when stratified by sex, the association between smoking and lung cancer decreases, but the estimated RR is approximately the same in each stratum.

**Interaction Factor:**

- Inhalation: RR = 2.43
- No Inhalation: RR = 1.20

It is linked to the realization of a risk inherent in the care provided. An example is the occurrence of a side effect of a correctly prescribed and administered medicine. 

Therapeutic hazard is defined as a medical accident (an unforeseen event causing damage with a certain causal link to the medical act), an iatrogenic condition (the care provided to the patient caused the damage), or a nosocomial infection (the infection appears after hospitalization and was absent on the day of admission) which occurred without any responsibility on the part of the healthcare professionals or the healthcare establishment. 

According to case law, the therapeutic hazard consists of ""the occurrence, through no fault of the practitioner, of an accidental risk inherent in the medical act and which could not be controlled."" Any risk inherent in the act of treatment, diagnosis, or prevention may constitute a therapeutic hazard.",1.0,14.895384615384618,False,True,0.7808762788772583,0.6309114694595337,b,False,3,3

## Definitions

Adjustment is a method of statistical analysis used to account for one or more confounding factors (a third factor linked to both the exposure being investigated and the occurrence of the health phenomenon being studied).

A measure of adjusted association is often the result of a multivariate analysis method (such as linear regression, logistic regression, or a Cox model) which makes it possible to identify the exposure factors studied that are independently linked to the phenomenon studied (judgment criterion), taking account of confounding factors (their effect is neutralized). This means identifying the impact of the exposure factors studied, all other things being equal.

Unadjusted measures of association are referred to as gross.

Example: The following table is taken from ""Prado et al, Lancet Oncol 2008, 9:629-35"" and presents crude (Univariate analysis) and adjusted (Multivariate analysis) hazard ratios measuring the association between the presence of sarcopenia (exposure factor studied) and survival (endpoint) in obese patients with respiratory or digestive cancer. The association between sarcopenia and survival in these patients was significant in univariate analysis, with a crude HR of 2.4 (IC95%=[1.5-3.9]). This association remained significant after adjustment for functional status, cancer location, and stage with an adjusted HR of 4.2 (CI95%=[2.4-7.2]).

**1. Subarachnoid Haemorrhage (SAH) or Meningeal Haemorrhage (item 341)**

- SAH or meningeal haemorrhage: Cause of 10 to 25% of sudden headaches.
- Typical headache (SAH due to rupture of aneurysm): Explosive, thunderclap-like, severe, associated with other signs of meningeal syndrome and persistent cervicalgia.
- Sometimes an isolated, short-lived headache (meningeal epistaxis of low severity, preceding a massive SAH).
- Associated signs: Comitial seizures, focal deficit (if cerebral-meningeal haemorrhage), III paralysis (compression by an aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery or carotid termination), and/or consciousness disorder (transient or coma).

**2. Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS)**

- RCVS: 10 to 45% of thunderclap headaches in emergency departments; under-diagnosed because of recent description (2007).
- SVCR: Segmental and diffuse vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries, reversible within 3 months. May be complicated by cortical SAH without aneurysm and stroke (item 340) (either cerebral haemorrhage or cerebral infarction).
- Typical headache: Thunderclap headache, lasting 5 minutes to several hours and recurring over 1 to 3 weeks, usually provoked by exertion, emotion, Valsalva, or sexual activity.
- Other associated signs: Hypertensive crisis, comitial seizures, and/or focal deficit.
- Evocative contexts: Postpartum, exposure to vasoactive substances (cannabis, cocaine, serotonergic antidepressants, sympathomimetics, nasal decongestants, or triptan) or stress.

**3. Rarer Causes of Sudden Headache**

The following sudden headaches have few specific characteristics and should be investigated after ruling out SAH and if the picture does not suggest CVRS.

- **Intracerebral Hemorrhage:** Headache sometimes isolated, with focal deficit absent or very discreet (frontal or cerebellar hemorrhage) (see stroke item 340).
- **Ischaemic Stroke:** Headache sometimes isolated, with focal deficit absent or very discrete (especially in cerebellar infarction) (see stroke item 340).
- **Dissection of Cervical Arteries:** Acute headache with cervicalgia.
  - Carotid dissection: On the side of the dissection: Claude-Bernard Horner, pulsatile tinnitus, paralysis of XII, orbital pain.
  - Vertebral dissection: Posterior neck pain and cervicalgia.
  - Headache precedes signs of retinal or cerebral ischaemia (transient amaurosis, TIA, or stroke) (stroke item 340).
- **Cerebral Venous Thrombosis:** More often gives progressive headaches by JTIC, but sometimes brutal headaches (stroke item 340).
- **Pituitary Apoplexy or Necrosis:** Abrupt headache, visual disturbances, bitemporal hemianopsia, then signs of pituitary insufficiency, postpartum setting, sometimes complicates a pituitary adenoma (pituitary adenoma item 244).
- **Cardiovascular Causes:** (Myocardial ischaemia, aortic dissection) by projected pain: rare.
- **Acute HTIC:** Acute hydrocephalus on certain intracranial tumours (item 299) compressing the 3rd or 4th ventricle, transient brutal headache on movement or coughing, later becoming permanent.
- **Hypertensive Encephalopathy and Eclampsia:** Headache preceding the signs of encephalopathy (consciousness disorders ¬± focal deficits ¬± epilepsy) with hypertension.
- **Intracranial Hypotension:** Postural orthostatic headache that disappears with decubitus; most often revealed by a progressive headache.
- **Meningitis and Meningoencephalitis (item 151):** Headache with infectious syndrome; most often reveals itself as a progressive headache.

- Exclude frequently associated DVT.

Treatment of DVT of the lower limb is based on:

- Elastic compression.
- Combined with anticoagulant treatment for 6 weeks with fondaparinux 2.5 mg, administered as 1 subcutaneous injection per day (prophylactic dose).

If the end of the DVT is close to the deep venous network or if the DVT extends into the deep venous network, the anticoagulant treatment is that of a DVT administered at a therapeutic dose.

When DVT occurs in varicose veins, treatment of the varicose veins should be discussed at a distance from the thrombotic episode.",0.7,11.336521739130436,False,True,0.8112450838088989,0.8604280749956766,b,False,2,4

== Definitions ==

The diagnosis of cystitis is fairly straightforward, but there are a few important points to bear in mind:

- These are acute symptoms. Old symptoms are very rarely of infectious origin even if bacteriuria is demonstrated.
- The most frequent symptoms of the lower urinary tract are those of the filling phase:
  - Pollakiuria
  - Urinary urgency
  - Incontinence sometimes
- Dysuria is sometimes noted, but this is related to pollakiuria (the patient ""forces an empty bladder"" because the need is felt).
- The main symptom is urinary burning.
- Other frequent symptoms: discreet haematuria, pyuria, bladder tenesmus with pelvic pain/weight at the end of micturition.
- These symptoms are the only way of expressing a ""bladder disorder."" Many pathologies (idiopathic overactive bladder, bladder tumour, etc.) manifest themselves in the same way. It is often a careful history that helps to distinguish between a recent and an old event.

Remember that the evolution of simple cystitis is not pyelonephritis!

In the absence of any anatomical or functional abnormality, cystitis does not become pyelonephritis (hence the classification of cystitis at risk of complications). This rare complication accounts for less than 1% of cystitis cases. This explains why the clinical presentation of acute pyelonephritis (ANP) is febrile back pain without any lower urinary tract symptoms.",1.0,8.756666666666668,False,True,0.7699881792068481,0.6161957383155823,c,False,4,3

During the consultation, a distinction should be made between:

- A patient taking treatment and not knowing she was pregnant.
- A patient taking treatment and wishing to become pregnant.
- The discovery of a birth defect in a child. It should be remembered that the prevalence of foetal malformations in the general population is approximately 2 to 3%, with less than 5% linked to a medicinal cause.

The first situation involves recording the circumstances in which the medication was taken: duration, quantity, and indication. For a drug with a known teratogenic potential, it is important to know whether it was taken during the 1st trimester, during organogenesis. The assessment of maternal benefit and foetal risk should also be detailed, as there are situations where there is a maternal risk when treatment is stopped. Whether or not to continue the pregnancy based on these elements may be discussed at the Pluridisciplinary Centre for Prenatal Diagnosis, after the couple has been informed.

The second situation consists of adapting the treatment during a pre-conception consultation with the best-known treatment for pregnancy. For this, the practitioner can be assisted by the regional pharmacovigilance services and by the prescriber of the treatment (organ specialist).

In the third situation, the imputability of a treatment requires the chronology of its administration to be retraced, if possible with the dosage, and reported to a pharmacovigilance centre. All these data provide valuable assistance to the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM), enabling it to establish, in conjunction with preclinical studies in animals, whether or not the product is suitable for use during pregnancy.

Advice on the teratogenicity of medicines can be sought from the teratogenicity reference centre (CRAT).

- Urine dipstick (supplemented if necessary by an ECBU) is necessary to exclude a low urinary infection and to suspect hyperconcentration of urine leading to micturition problems.
- Except in special cases, no further examination is necessary at the first consultation.

== Diagnostic Steps for Micturition Disorders ==

If, after questioning and clinical examination, the primary nature of the micturition disorder is not fully established, a urinary debimetry test, an ultrasound scan of the urinary tract with measurement of the post-micturition residue, or even a urodynamic assessment may be suggested. The aim is then to find an organic cause of the voiding problems, such as:

- Malformative uropathy such as posterior urethral valves causing urethral obstruction to urine flow. Diagnosis may be made in the ante-natal or neonatal period when a bladder globe is discovered with an absent or dripping urine stream and dysuria.
- Malformative uropathy such as an ectopic abruption of the ureter of the upper pyelone of a double urinary system, which manifests itself when the diagnosis is not made in the ante-natal period by permanent urinary incontinence with preserved micturition.
- A congenital neurovessel in association with congenital spinal cord disease or spinal dysraphism (closure anomalies on the median line of the spine, skin, or vertebral bodies). The diagnosis of a neurological bladder may be suspected when a spinal dysraphism is present at birth, or when voiding problems are initially considered benign but repeatedly fail to resolve, or when a work-up is carried out for another symptom, such as severe constipation. Thus, in the case of any micturition disorder, a possible neurological cause should be systematically investigated, especially as the child gets older. The same applies when there is constipation or fecal leakage, which may also be the reason for consultation.",0.6,16.816,False,True,0.7873462438583374,0.7029974659283956,c,False,2,3

**Rubric:** Definition

**Definitions**

The Social Security Financing Act establishes the general conditions for the financial equilibrium of the social security system and, based on revenue forecasts, sets expenditure targets. It is passed each year by parliament following a government bill.

The Social Security Financing Act (LFSS) is a category of law created by the revision of the Constitution on 22 February 1996. It aims to control social and health spending. It determines the conditions necessary for the financial equilibrium of social security and sets expenditure targets based on revenue forecasts.

It should be emphasized that this is a financing law rather than a finance law, indicating that the LFSS is not of the same nature as the State's finance laws; in particular, they have no budgetary scope. Parliamentary control remains limited. Parliament does not have the power to set social security revenues itself. The LFSS does not authorize the collection of revenue; it merely forecasts it. Similarly, the expenditure targets voted by Parliament assess expenditure but do not limit it.

The LFSS is voted on by Parliament every year, at the same time as the Finance Act (LF) that determines the State budget. It must be submitted to the National Assembly by 15 October at the latest. Parliament must vote on it within 50 days; otherwise, the PLFSS may be adopted by ordinance. It may also be amended during the year by an amending LFSS.

Since 1996, Parliament has had a say in the financial equilibrium of the social security system. It can give its opinion on the broad outlines of health and social security policies, as well as on the way they are financed.

Examples of new measures include:
- Extending paternity leave from 14 days to 28 days and making it compulsory for 7 days.
- Increasing the salaries of hospital staff and those working in accommodation establishments for dependent elderly people (EHPAD).
- Funding expenditure on tests, vaccines, and masks to respond to the health crisis.
- Creating a 5th branch of social security to support independent living.",0.4,8.009090909090911,False,True,0.732672929763794,0.5584565997123718,c,True,5,3

The guide ""Eruptive Diseases, Purpura, and Dermatitis in Children"" by Dr. Girodias, a pediatrician at Sainte Justine Hospital in Montreal, is a valuable resource for understanding the etiologies of febrile eruptions, with their epidemiological and clinical characteristics.

**1. Look for an Emergency**

- Haemodynamic failure: purpura fulminans, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome
- Mucosal ulcerations with or without epidermal detachments: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Lyell syndrome, erythema multiforme major, epidermolysis
- Erythema, facial edema, adenopathy, general deterioration, multivisceral involvement with hypereosinophilia: DRESS
- Fever ‚â• 5 days with cervical adenopathy, mucosal involvement (conjunctivitis, glossitis), pharyngitis, extremity edema: Kawasaki disease
- Warm, painful infiltrated localized erythema: bacterial dermo-hypodermatitis, necrotizing fasciitis

**2. Characterize the Rash**

- Type of elementary lesion, chronology of appearance in relation to fever, location, and evolution of lesions
- Macular exanthema without an interval of healthy skin (scarlatiniform): scarlet fever, staphylococcal toxic shock, staphylococcal epidermolysis
- Maculopapular exanthema (morbilliform): measles, rubella, Parvovirus B19, roseola (HHV6), enterovirus/parechovirus, Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, laterothoracic exanthema, NIDs
- Vesiculo-pustular exanthema: chickenpox, herpes (primary infection with stomatitis, otherwise non-febrile), coxsackie (Hand Foot Mouth Syndrome)
- Aspecific exanthema: viral, systemic disease

**3. Search for Associated Anamnestic Elements**

- History: immunosuppression, co-morbidities
- Contagion (community), vaccinations
- Medication taken (precise date in relation to onset of signs)

**4. Search for Associated Clinical Features**

- Respiratory signs: measles, aspecific virosis
- Angina: scarlet fever, NID

**5. Diagnostic Confirmation**

Some diagnoses are clinically based and do not require further investigation in the absence of a risk situation (e.g., chickenpox, epidemic megalerythema, sudden exanthema). Others, such as Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, are based on a combination of clinical and biological evidence, while others (NID, measles) are based on microbiology (PCR saliva and/or blood, depending on the virus, or serology with IgM detection).

**Local Extension Assessment**

- Local extension assessment is based on mammography and ultrasound. It looks for additional lesions and axillary adenopathy.
- Apart from high-risk situations (BRCA 1 or 2 mutated patients), MRI is recommended in cases where the clinical, mammography, and ultrasound findings are inconsistent, or where it is difficult to assess tumour size or the number of lesions if conservative treatment is envisaged.

**Remote Extension Assessment**

- Preferred metastatic sites are bone, lung, liver, skin, distant adenopathy, and brain.
- Extension work-up to look for visceral or bone metastases is not systematic. It should not delay referral to a specialist centre, where a decision will be made if necessary (according to INCa recommendations, June 2020).
- Axillary exploration is carried out by analysis of the sentinel lymph node (1 to 4 lymph nodes) ""in the absence of lymph node invasion"" (clinical or histological) and ""breast lesion less than 5 cm"" preoperatively. If this is not the case (proven lymph node invasion or breast lesion of more than 5 cm), an axillary curage (removal of all the axillary lymph nodes) will be carried out intraoperatively. The sentinel lymph node technique significantly reduces the risk of complications associated with lymph node dissection (lymphoedema).
- An extension assessment is carried out when there are negative prognostic factors. For example, it should always be carried out in the case of lymph node invasion (clinical or histological) or a pre-operative lesion larger than 5 cm.
- In this case, the first intention work-up is based on one of the following two options:

Sudden death during exercise is in the vast majority of cases of cardiovascular origin.

The causes of contraindications to sporting activities are primarily cardiovascular:

- Cardiac pathologies causing rhythm disorders: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic dysplasia of the right ventricle, birth defects of the coronary arteries, Brugada syndrome, long QT, short QT, etc.
- Progressive or unbalanced cardiovascular pathologies: unstable coronary artery disease, unstable heart failure, unbalanced hypertension, myocarditis, etc.

In addition to cardiovascular causes, there are certain unbalanced or severe pathologies:

- Loss of consciousness not investigated
- Evolving or ongoing respiratory diseases
- Morbid lack of weight and height
- Severe morphological disorders
- Serious neurological pathologies

There are also contraindications specific to certain sports (non-exhaustive list):

- Contact sports: loss of a paired organ (eye, kidney, gonad, etc.) to prevent loss of the second organ during practice.
- Collision or contact sports: haemophilia, anticoagulant treatment
- Boxing: myopia (increased risk of retinal detachment)
- Underwater diving: asthma, history of pneumothorax, ENT pathologies",0.6,14.312857142857148,False,True,0.85843425989151,0.5101720690727234,a,False,2,4

**Definitions**

- BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) and its precursor NT proBNP are peptides secreted by atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes when tissue is strained. Their value reflects the average pressure regime in the heart chambers.

- Normal values of BNP (<100 pg/ml) or NT-proBNP (<300 pg/ml) make a diagnosis very unlikely in the presence of acute dyspnoea.

- BNP > 300 pg/ml or NT-proBNP with age-dependent threshold values:
  - > 450 pg/ml in subjects under 50
  - > 900 pg/ml between the ages of 50 and 75
  - > 1800 pg/ml for those over 75 years of age

The interpretation of natriuretic peptides is crucial in the context of acute dyspnoea.

**What You Need to Know to Interpret the Rates**

- Increases with age in women
- Decreases with obesity
- Increased in cases of renal insufficiency or atrial fibrillation
- Treatment with ARNI (Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor), represented by the combination of Sacubitril and Valsartan (Entresto¬Æ), leads to an increase in BNP concentrations which cannot be interpreted.

Imaging is not routinely recommended in confusion (mental confusion/disorientation), but a CT scan or, depending on the hypotheses and availability of tests, a cerebral MRI should be requested as a matter of urgency at the slightest suspicion of an underlying neurological lesion:

- In the event of focal signs on neurological examination
- If there is a recent history of head trauma or anticoagulant treatment (subdural or parenchymal hematoma) (see item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic subdural hematoma).
- Before any lumbar puncture in cases of suspected meningoencephalitis (item 151. Meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess in adults and children)
- If confusion has set in suddenly (suspected stroke item 340).

Outside the context of confusion, a cerebral MRI is essential for diagnosing a neurocognitive disorder and therefore Alzheimer's disease. In the event of contraindication, a cerebral CT scan will be performed. The objectives are:

- Rule out a non-degenerative cause, looking in particular for:
  - An intracranial expansive process (intra- or extracerebral tumor, subdural hematoma, etc.)
  - Hydrocephalus (see item 109. Gait and balance disorders and cf. item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic hydrocephalus in adults)
  - Ischaemic and hemorrhagic vascular lesions (useful sequences: T2/FLAIR and T2 gradient echo, respectively): MRI is far superior to CT for analyzing vascular lesions (see item 132 question Positive diagnosis - Vascular encephalopathy).

- Look for cerebral atrophy:
  - Assess the presence of cortical or subcortical atrophy and its topography (frontal, anterior cingulate and anterior temporal as in frontotemporal lobar degeneration, posterior or global as in Alzheimer's disease)

## Definitions

Lung opacity is a term generally reserved for chest radiography. It is characterized by a loss of normal radiolucency in the lung, which can take on very different forms depending on its size, morphology, contours, location, and whether it is more or less opaque, systematized, retractile, etc. A radiographic pulmonary opacity will correspond in CT to more precise semiological descriptors: nodule, mass, condensation, ground glass, etc.

The etiological range of pulmonary opacities is very broad. It covers diseases of the lung parenchyma, but also beyond, since pleural, parietal, or mediastinal abnormalities may be projected radiographically into the lung areas. Radiographic opacities can thus be categorized into syndromes: alveolar syndrome, interstitial syndrome, nodular syndrome, cavitary syndrome, bronchial syndrome, mediastinal syndrome, pleural syndrome, and parietal syndrome.

Examples of opacities visible in pulmonary projection on chest X-ray include:
- Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura
- Infectious pneumonia of the right middle and lower lobes
- Aneurysm of the aortic arch
- Pleural plaques in a patient exposed to asbestos

Among pulmonary opacities, a well-circumscribed round opacity (nodular syndrome) should suggest lung cancer until proven otherwise. However, this presentation is neither sensitive nor specific. In fact, the majority of pulmonary nodules (3mm-3cm) seen on CT are benign, and conversely, lung cancer may present as a mediastinal or hilar mass. Only histological examination can confirm malignancy.

Examples include:
- Lung nodule in right basal projection showing fatty content on CT, signaling benignity (pulmonary hamartochondroma)
- Right hilar mass found to be small cell bronchial carcinoma",0.5555555555555556,17.28315789473685,False,True,0.7816091179847717,0.631255567073822,c,False,3,3

The main differential diagnoses of AD are:

- **Mental Confusion** (Abnormal genital bleeding (SD-112))  
  - Beware! Confusion may reveal dementia or occur during dementia. Always consider AD or another dementia after a confusional episode.

- **Functional Causes of Cognitive Impairment**  
  - Depression (Sad mood/moral pain (SDD-123)), chronic anxiety (SDD-116)  
    - Diagnose: depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder, personality disorder.  
    - Use of psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, hypnotics, etc.).  
    - Sleep disorders (insomnia and sleep apnea) (SDD-135)  
    - May lead to attention and executive function problems affecting memory function (""pseudo-amnesia"" marked by encoding and retrieval problems).  
    - Beware! Depression and anxiety can be associated with AD. Suggest trial treatment with antidepressants and reassess cognition later.

- **Organic Causes**  
  - ""Secondary"" and possibly curable dementia  
    - Hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency, syphilis, HIV, certain brain tumors (frontal meningiomas).  
    - Chronic adult hydrocephalus (formerly ""normal pressure"" hydrocephalus)  
      - Leads to disorders of walking (with small steps) and balance, frontal-type cognitive disorders with apathy, and urinary control disorders.  
      - Diagnostic and therapeutic test: evacuating lumbar punctures. Surgical treatment by ventriculoperitoneal shunt is proposed when diagnostic probability is high.  
    - Subdural hematoma: a frequent cause of cognitive disorders in the elderly, often detected at a distance from a head injury, even mild or unnoticed. Favored by dehydration, chronic alcoholism, and treatments affecting coagulation.

**Title:** Alcohol and Pregnancy: Screening

**Description:** Methods of Questioning - Detection

Questioning is the key to screening. It should be intensified in the following clinical situations:

- History of FAS/malformative syndrome in the offspring (very high risk of recurrence)
- Drug addiction (30-50% of patients on drug substitutes drink alcohol)
- Context of domestic violence, sexual abuse
- Psychiatric disorders, depression
- Heavy smoking
- Ultrasound findings of growth retardation or malformations

It is important to adopt an empathetic attitude and a non-judgmental framework, preferring indirect and/or open-ended questions: ""Before pregnancy, how many drinks did you have a day? And now?"" or ""Is it difficult for you not to drink alcohol now?"" A good method is to use validated self-questionnaires such as the T-ACE, which even seem to be more sensitive than questioning in detecting maternal alcohol consumption.

**T-ACE Questionnaire:**

- **T:** How many drinks do you have to have before you feel the first effects of alcohol?  
  *2 points if ‚â• 3 drinks*
  
- **A:** Have you ever been bothered by people criticizing you for your drinking?  
  *1 point if yes*
  
- **C:** Do you sometimes feel the need to reduce your consumption?  
  *1 point if yes*
  
- **E:** Do you sometimes have a drink as soon as you get out of bed in the morning to calm down or get rid of a hangover?

**Description:** Taking account of the patient's individual situation to adjust the benefit/risk ratio for prescribing purposes

**Rubric:** Management

Prescribing a drug must consider the patient's individual situation and requires knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug, as well as a comparison with the patient's physiology, particularly age, weight, and the functional capacity of the main purifying organs. This individual assessment should be carried out systematically before any initial prescription or prescription renewal to assess the ""benefit/risk ratio"" and should continue throughout the prescription period.

== Pre-therapeutic Assessment ==
Before any prescription is given, the patient must be assessed based on:

- **Demographic characteristics:** Age (extreme ages may require treatment adaptation), weight (extreme weights can impact drug pharmacokinetics), and ethnic origin (certain genetic polymorphisms may lead to treatment restrictions or adaptations).
- **Medical history:** Any allergies and intercurrent pathologies that may contraindicate certain drugs.
- **Assessment of major drug purification functions:** Evaluation of renal function (estimate of glomerular filtration rate) and liver function (presence and severity of hepatocellular insufficiency).
- **Current drug treatments:** Already prescribed medications and/or self-medicated drugs, which may need adaptation depending on the risk of drug interaction.

== Therapeutic Objective ==
The prescriber must establish a therapeutic objective in a concerted manner with the patient, based on objective factors that enable assessment of this objective. These include:

- For curative treatment, measurable or perceived improvements in the patient's condition.
- For preventive treatment, reliance on public health data indicating a reduction in the risk of an event.

== Definition of the Individual Benefit/Risk Ratio ==
The prescriber must assess the benefit and risk of the drug prescription according to scientific data, mainly from phase III and IV therapeutic trials. This report is evolving for a medicinal product in a given indication and must be frequently re-evaluated based on new scientific information. The benefit/risk ratio must be considered in terms of the patient's individual situation, including specific benefits and risks in the population subgroup to which the patient belongs.

== Choice of Treatment ==
These factors should help determine the appropriate drug(s) as part of a treatment tailored to the individual patient. The selection criteria are based on:

- **Authorisation de mise sur le march√© (AMM):** The medicinal product's market authorization for a precise indication. Prescription outside the scope of the MA can only be exceptional and must follow strict conditions defined in article L. 5121-12-1 of the French Public Health Code.
- **Level of evidence:** The drug's efficacy in the indication in question. The choice between two medicinal products for the same indication should be guided by the highest level of evidence, and where equal, preference should be given to the product with the greatest experience of use.
- **Pre-therapeutic assessment, therapeutic objective, and individual benefit-risk ratio:** Previously established for this patient.

== Treatment Evaluation ==
Once the prescription is made, provision must be made for monitoring the treatment, and the prescriber must evaluate the treatment on an ongoing basis. This evaluation covers:

- **Efficacy of the treatment:** Consistency with the therapeutic objective defined above.
- **Safety profile assessment:** Focus on the main adverse reaction signals detected during therapeutic trials and pharmacovigilance monitoring.
- **Drug monitoring:** Based on clinical data (e.g., blood pressure measurement for antihypertensive drugs), biological data (e.g., blood sugar monitoring for diabetes treatment), and pharmacovigilance data, including pharmacological therapeutic monitoring (e.g., measurement of blood concentrations of immunosuppressants in the context of organ transplantation rejection prevention).

These elements of treatment evaluation enable the ""benefit-risk ratio"" to be reassessed throughout the prescription period and may require the drug to be adapted or discontinued depending on changes in the ratio.",0.7142857142857143,11.693684210526317,False,True,0.8018256425857544,0.7241997917493185,d,False,3,4

# Objectives and Principles of Pharmacovigilance

The aim of pharmacovigilance is to monitor, assess, prevent, and manage the risk of adverse reactions resulting from the use of medicinal products, whether these risks are potential or proven, in real-life situations. The goal is to improve the risk/benefit ratio of medicines, both individually and collectively. The operation of pharmacovigilance is governed by the Public Health Code and good pharmacovigilance practice.

## Products Concerned by Pharmacovigilance

- Medicines and products covered by a marketing authorisation (MA), once this authorisation has been issued, or covered by a temporary recommendation for use (RTU) or temporary authorisation for use (ATU).
- Homeopathic medicines, after registration.
- Traditional herbal medicinal products, after registration.
- Allergens, specially prepared for a single individual.
- Blood-derived medicinal products and other medicinal products of human origin.
- Magistral, hospital, and officinal preparations.
- Certain dietetic products.

## Pharmacovigilance Stakeholders

- Healthcare professionals (compulsory reporting of any adverse reaction suspected to be due to a medicinal product for doctors, pharmacists, dentists, and midwives, particularly serious and/or unexpected reactions).
- Companies or organisations exploiting medicinal products.
- Patients and approved patient associations.
- Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres (CRPV), coordinated by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM).
- The ANSM.
- The European Medicines Agency (EMA).

## Missions of the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres

- Collection, documentation, analysis, and recording of alerts.
- Signal detection and transmission.
- Response to enquiries about the safe use of a medicine.
- Expertise.
- Training and research (studies and research into the safe use of medicines).

## Role of the Health Authorities, ANSM, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)

- Collection and centralisation of data on medicinal products. Reported cases are entered into the National Pharmacovigilance Database managed by ANSM, then at the European level, into the European Pharmacovigilance Database ""Eudravigilance"", and then into the World Health Organisation's (WHO) international pharmacovigilance database called VigiBase¬Æ.
- Analysis of periodic safety reports and monitoring of risk reduction measures set out in risk management plans.
- Analysis of signals reported, request to open an investigation, reconsideration of the benefit-risk ratio, which may lead to decisions being taken in conjunction with the EMA, such as mentioning a new effect in the summary of product characteristics, restricting the use of the medicinal product, or suspending the marketing authorisation, for example.

## Methods for Assessing Adverse Drug Reactions

- Pharmaco-medical evaluation of reports of adverse drug reactions, assessment of imputability using the French reference method.
- Imputability corresponds to the estimate of the causal link between the drug and the observed effect.
- Pharmaco-epidemiological studies.",1.0,15.45,False,True,0.8241578340530396,0.6912768085797628,b,True,5,1

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Definitions**

A rib fracture is defined radiologically by a break in bone continuity at the non-cortical edges. On a chest X-ray, there is a break in the continuity of the line running along the upper and lower edges of the ribs. The lateral segment is most often affected, and multiple fractures occur in more than half the cases. In one out of two cases, a rib fracture is not detected on standard X-rays. CT scans are more sensitive in identifying rib fractures. Any displaced rib fracture should be scanned for pneumothorax, haemothorax, or laceration of the lung parenchyma.

The Higham score is used to assess menorrhagia severity. A costal flap is defined by the presence of two fracture sites involving at least three successive ribs. On clinical examination, a paradoxical movement of the hemithorax is observed. A rib flap is a serious injury often requiring intensive care and sometimes surgical treatment.

Damage to the first three ribs is a marker of high-energy trauma and may be associated with vascular or nerve damage (brachial plexus). Involvement of the 8th to 11th costal arches should prompt a search for an upper abdominal injury (hepatic or splenic).

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis

Vascular encephalopathy is the second most common cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly after Alzheimer's disease.

Clinical signs depend on the location and extent of the cerebrovascular lesions. Cerebral lesions may be of ischaemic or haemorrhagic origin and may induce mild cognitive impairment (minor TNC) or a dementia syndrome (major TNC).

There are several types of lesions that can cause cognitive problems:

- Multiple infarctions
- Multi-lacunar infarctions
- Diffuse leukoencephalopathy
- Strategic infarction (e.g., thalamus or angular gyrus)
- Hypoperfusion
- Amyloid angiopathy

The sudden onset of cognitive impairment, or the classic ""stair-step"", is suggestive but not necessary. In diffuse encephalopathy, particularly lacunar encephalopathy, a progressive onset is observed.

On clinical examination, there may be focal neurological sequelae (pyramidal syndrome, motor deficit, homonymous lateral hemianopia, etc.) and extra-pyramidal rigidity (if there is vascular damage to the basal ganglia). Cognitive disorders are heterogeneous (dysexecutive, psychomotor slowing, etc.).",1.0,15.433333333333337,False,True,0.814221203327179,0.6216324170430502,a,False,3,4

**Title:** Respect for Autonomy  
**Description:** Understanding the ethical foundations and legal provisions relating to respect for patients' autonomy and consent to care, including familiarity with the law of 4 March 2002 on the rights of patients, the principle of respect for patients' wishes, and the concept of free and informed consent.

## I. Autonomy, Information, and Consent

Today, due to the democratization of our healthcare system and patients' desire to access medical knowledge, there is a growing demand for participation in the care process. This raises the need to provide quality information, obtain consent, and respect patients' freedom of choice. Medical practice now centers on patient autonomy, with patient participation in decision-making recognized as a right, except in cases of vulnerability, emergency, or psychological incapacity.

The principle of autonomy originates from modern philosophy in the 17th century, leading to Enlightenment philosophy in the 18th century. Descartes, in his ""Discourse on Method,"" asserted the mind's sovereignty over the body, a condition of freedom. Jean Jacques Rousseau's social contract theory further supports individual rights within common law, allowing freedom of thought, belief, and destiny.

Historically, patient freedom in healthcare was ignored, with decisions made without patient consent or information. This paternalistic approach has shifted since the 1970s, with a demand for patient involvement in choices affecting them. Nilstum defined paternalism as acting for others' good without considering their preferences. Today, patient autonomy is recognized through shared decision-making, requiring healthcare providers to inform and consider patients' questions, wishes, and values.

Autonomy is not absolute; it may be limited by a patient's diminishing ability to analyze and decide or by demands conflicting with healthcare system values. Respect for autonomy requires providing information before obtaining consent. Consent without quality information is illegitimate.

French legislation enshrined respect for autonomy, starting with a 1988 law on biomedical research and bioethics laws since 1994, addressing information and consent in specific cases like biomedical research, organ donation, and genetic testing. The 2002 law on patients' rights recognized the right to information and consent in all healthcare practices.

Patients have the right to be informed about examinations or treatments affecting their bodies and lives. They should receive all necessary information to make their own choices, ultimately deciding whether to exercise their autonomy.

The quality of information provided is crucial, impacting professional responsibility and patient autonomy. Complete information, including uncertainties, reinforces patient decision-making autonomy, even if it complicates their choices. Information is not neutral.

The information process relies on the patient's ability to understand medical discourse. ""Understanding"" means the patient integrates information with personal experiences and fears, forming a basis for dialogue with the doctor.

The duty to inform covers two levels:

- **Ethical:** Recognizing and promoting patient autonomy as the democratic basis for respecting and protecting individuals.
- **Legal:** Obligation to provide high-quality information for informed acceptance or refusal of treatment.

Information should primarily be given orally by healthcare professionals, ensuring patient understanding based on their condition. Educational documents can aid this process. Information documents are not for collecting signed consent but for providing information patients can revisit.

Quality information must:

- Ensure transparency and integrity based on current scientific and medical data.
- Inform about benefits and risks, highlighting uncertainties.
- Illuminate the care course, physical and psychological inconveniences, care pathway organization, social rights, and available support.
- Facilitate choices between validated medical approaches compatible with the patient's situation.

## II. Refusal of Care

Ethical debates about refusing care are common, with autonomy raising questions. A patient's refusal can challenge carers trained to act for others' benefit. Sometimes refusal aligns with medical opinion, such as at the end of life, under the Claeys-L√©onetti law, which allows limiting or discontinuing care to avoid unreasonable obstinacy.

Refusal of care questions autonomy. Clinical contexts can reveal autonomy loss beyond geriatrics or psychiatry, raising two questions:

- Is the refusal an act of will based on deliberative autonomy, understanding the medical proposal and its consequences?
- Should the patient's word be accepted as is?

Accepting refusal outright means it's an acceptable choice, aligning with clinical and medical assessments. Otherwise, refusal may prompt a care attitude allowing time for explanations and further discussion.

Easily accepting refusal denies nursing's role in guiding acceptance and shared decision-making. Refusal can signal psychological deficiency, suffering, or despair, which medicine aims to address for better patient outcomes. The ethical question is how far to go in explaining and convincing without forcing. Time is crucial for assessing situations, requiring relationships and regular exchanges.

Medicine guides individual autonomy assessment, exploring abilities like understanding information, memory, decision-making, and maintaining decisions. Clinical assessments range from major to minor impairment, questioning the weight of ""non-autonomy"" in overriding patient wishes. Beneficence often guides decisions in impaired autonomy situations. Acting against patient opinion requires considering expected benefits, avoiding traumatic violence, and maintaining dignity.

Complex decisions advocate a three-stage collegial process:

a) Pre-decision time for case investigation, argumentation, and adapting decisions to patient situations, avoiding individual decisions.
b) Decision time by a designated individual, guided by beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice.
c) Post-decision time for continued discussion, responsibility, and monitoring.

Some situations resist or refuse care refusal, like immediate life-threatening emergencies. In such cases, medical action is prioritized, even against patient refusal, due to impaired discernment.

For example, a suicidal patient or a diabetic teenager refusing insulin therapy requires intervention despite refusal. Accepting refusal without debate denies complex patient thinking and cries for help, necessitating adapted care approaches.

Refusal of care also raises public health concerns, like opposition to vaccinations or refusal of prophylactic treatments, risking community health. Medical practice cannot degrade when other interests are at stake beyond the patient.

Medicine must balance individual convictions with public good, preventing, treating, and assisting based on collective welfare. An extreme autonomist view would respect endangerments as rights, reducing healthcare to consumerism and redefining its ethical aim. Paul Ricoeur's ethical aim of ""the good life, with and for others, in just institutions"" emphasizes the need for rules and duties ensuring social protection and equal care access.",1.0,17.76,False,True,0.7705034613609314,0.6751807530721029,b,False,2,4

**Epidemiology**

- Primary infection linked to the VZV virus (Varicella Zoster Virus), Herpesviridae, subfamily alpha-herpesvirinae.
- Very frequent infection in children
- Human-to-human contagiousness: airborne (aerosol) or contact with vesicles
- Primary infection with VZV results in chickenpox, reactivation results in shingles

**Clinical Features**

- Incubation: 2 weeks
- Contagion: 2 days before rash until lesions crust over (about 1 week)
- Most often a benign infection in children, but more severe in infants under 1 year of age and adolescents.
- Classic form: 2-stage evolution
  - Pre-eruptive: fever
  - Eruptive: vesicles appearing in successive outbreaks (lesions of different ages), all over the body, possibly reaching the mucous membranes (mouth), progressing to crusting, accompanied by pruritus which is sometimes very intense. A fever accompanies the eruption (fever as long as there are new vesicle outbreaks, if fever when there are no new lesions beware of bacterial superinfection). The image shows typical varicella lesions.
- Severe forms (subjects at risk)
  - Neonatal: chickenpox in the mother with a rash from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery. Children need to be treated with anti-VZV immunoglobulin and aciclovir, even if asymptomatic, because of the severity.
  - In immunocompromised patients: risk of severe pneumonia, fulminant hepatitis, multiple organ failure. Systematic treatment is required.
  - Pregnant women: foetopathy before 20 weeks' gestation, pneumonia in pregnant women
  - Adolescents and adults: profuse form, respiratory involvement

**Complications**

- Viral (see subjects at risk above): pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis
- Bacterial superinfections:
  - Cutaneous (Streptococcus A and Staphylococcus aureus): dermohypodermatitis, fasciitis, toxic shock. Promoting role of NSAIDs
  - Respiratory: acute otitis media, pleuropneumonia
- Post-infectious: cerebellar ataxia (cerebellite), thrombocytopenic purpura
- Metabolic: Reye's syndrome in association with aspirin use

**Treatment and Prevention**

Treatment is symptomatic, with severe forms or chickenpox occurring in subjects at risk warranting the prescription of IV aciclovir.

Prevention is based on avoiding subjects at risk. In the event of exposure to a subject at risk, treatment with a specific immunoglobulin is indicated.

Post-exposure vaccination is justified in cases where it is not contraindicated (live vaccine therefore contraindicated in pregnant women and immunocompromised patients), i.e., in adolescents over 11 years of age and non-immune adults within 72 hours of contact.

Prevention of fetal risks (SDD-312) primary

This is the vaccination antirubella vaccine. Live vaccine not indicated during pregnancy. Its use has virtually eliminated congenital rubella in France. All women of child-bearing age should have been vaccinated, and the effectiveness of the vaccination should be checked by serology. Congenital rubella has become a completely preventable disease. However, almost 5% of pregnant women are still not immunized.

Prevention of fetal risks (SDD-312) secondary

An interpretation of an SDD-236 serology result is compulsory when declaring a pregnancy, with a test for IgG alone, except in cases of documented previous immunity (positive previous serology result or proof of injection of 2 doses of vaccine). If the initial serology is negative, the serology will be checked at 20 SA. Beyond that point, the fetal risk is so low that it no longer warrants monitoring.

If serology is positive in early pregnancy, this is usually due to immunity linked to a previous infection or vaccination. In the absence of any rash, contagion, or travel to a high-risk country, no further investigation is warranted. Conversely, if since the start of the pregnancy the patient reports:

- A rash
- Contact with a person who has shown symptoms compatible with rubella (rash, arthralgias)
- A trip to a high-risk country (Africa/Asia)

Biological tests in a reference laboratory are essential (IgM tests, as routine serology only includes IgG tests, and measurement of the IgG avidity index). If infection is confirmed before the 20th SA, the patient must be referred to a CPDPN for further management.",0.75,16.220000000000006,False,True,0.7896848917007446,0.6790217757225037,c,False,5,4

  - Sudden onset and abrupt cessation
  - Variable duration
  - A sensation of regular tachycardia
  - Post-critical polyuria
  - Termination by vagal maneuvers or injection of adenosine or 5'-adenosine triphosphate

**Title:** Knowing the Mechanisms Regulating Acid-Base Balance  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**A. pH and the Acid-Base Buffer System**

- Hydrogen potential (pH) = Log 1/[H‚Å∫]. The concentration of H‚Å∫ ions in plasma is very low and finely regulated.
- The quantity of H‚Å∫ entering the body through the diet is massive compared with its plasma concentration. To avoid a collapse of the post-prandial pH, incompatible with cellular life, the acid load is immediately buffered. The main acid-base buffer system in humans is the carbonic acid/bicarbonate pair: H‚Å∫ + HCO‚ÇÉ‚Åª ‚áî H‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ ‚áî CO‚ÇÇ + H‚ÇÇO.
- This buffer system is ""open"" because the acid generated is eliminated by respiration, and the bicarbonate is regenerated by the kidney.
- Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH_blood = 6.1 + log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ ([HCO‚ÇÉ‚Åª]/[H‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ]) = 6.1 + log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ ([HCO‚ÇÉ‚Åª]/0.03 PCO‚ÇÇ).
- The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation shows that the pH varies when the ratio between PCO‚ÇÇ and HCO‚ÇÉ‚Åª is modified:
  - When there is a primary change in the concentration of HCO‚ÇÉ‚Åª ions, known as alkalosis or metabolic acidosis.
  - When there is a primary change in PCO‚ÇÇ, known as respiratory alkalosis or acidosis.

**B. The Main Sources of Acid**

- There are two main sources of acid:
  - Volatile acids, derived from the cellular metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, generating, in the presence of O‚ÇÇ, water and CO‚ÇÇ (oxidative metabolism). The CO‚ÇÇ generated is eliminated directly by respiration, without modifying the acid-base balance in a physiological situation. Failure of ventilation to eliminate CO‚ÇÇ leads to respiratory acidosis.
  - Fixed acids, resulting from protein metabolism (H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ for sulfur-containing amino acids, HCl for lysine, H‚ÇÇPO‚ÇÑ for nucleoproteins). This acid load is around 1 mmol/kg/d and is buffered before being eliminated by the kidneys. Failure by the kidney to eliminate this acid load (renal failure or renal tubular acidosis) leads to metabolic acidosis.

**C. Role of the Lung in Acid-Base Balance**

- By excreting carbon dioxide through the respiratory tract, the lung modifies the pCO‚ÇÇ of arterial blood. A failure to eliminate CO‚ÇÇ through alveolar hypoventilation leads to respiratory acidosis. Conversely, increased elimination of CO‚ÇÇ by alveolar hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis.
- Regulation of pulmonary ventilation depends on PaO‚ÇÇ and pCO‚ÇÇ, but also on the pH of arterial blood. By reflex mechanism, through the intermediary of sensitive devices (aortic and carotid chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors), a fall in blood pH leads instantaneously to an increase in ventilation, and vice versa.

**D. Role of the Kidney in Acid-Base Balance**

- Reabsorption of bicarbonates filtered by the glomerulus. If this function is impaired, it can lead to metabolic acidosis. This is a function of the proximal parts of the renal tubule.
- Excretion of the fixed acid load (approximately 60 mEq/d), which is equivalent to regenerating the bicarbonates consumed. This is a function of the distal parts of the nephron (collecting duct). Failure of this kidney function leads to metabolic acidosis. In the case of chronic respiratory acidosis, renal compensation leads to an increase in bicarbonate generation and therefore in bicarbonate levels.",1.0,15.220000000000002,False,True,0.778755247592926,0.6775428652763367,c,False,4,4

Urticaria, atopic and contact dermatitis  
**Title:** Knowing the Main Causes of Urticaria  
**Description:** Physical, contact, food, drug, and infectious urticaria  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

In the vast majority of cases, acute and chronic urticaria are spontaneous, but certain favoring or triggering factors can be identified.

### Inducible or Physical Urticaria

These are urticaria appearing after contact or a situation that activates mast cells. The best known are dermographism, cold urticaria, cholinergic urticaria (after exertion, an emotion, a hot bath), delayed pressure urticaria, and more rarely solar urticaria, aquagenic urticaria (to water), or vibratory angioedema.

### Contact Urticaria

Urticaria appears in the area of skin contact with a stinging substance. It is generally non-immunological, but in the case of immunological contact urticaria, anaphylaxis is still possible even after contact.

Examples:
- Allergic contact urticaria to latex proteins contained in latex gloves or objects is an immunological contact urticaria with a risk of anaphylaxis.
- Nettle contact urticaria is a non-immunological contact urticaria localized solely to the area of skin contact.

### Food-Induced Urticaria

Foods are often implicated in urticaria, but IgE-dependent allergic food urticaria is rare.

In the case of acute food urticaria, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis should be considered if:
- The time between ingestion of the offending food and the onset of signs ranges from a few minutes to less than 2 hours.
- There are associated symptoms indicating the severity of the condition.
- Symptoms resolve in less than 12 hours.
- Recurrence each time the food is taken, which is generally more severe, regardless of the quantity of food ingested.

### Drug-Induced Urticaria

Many so-called ""histamino-releasing"" drugs can promote non-immunological mast cell activation. This is the case with NSAIDs, antibiotics, particularly from the beta-lactam family, morphine derivatives, and iodinated contrast products. These generally acute urticaria are non-allergic and occur several days after the drug has been taken.

Rare cases of acute urticaria are caused by immunological mechanisms via the activation of IgE antibodies specific to the drug in question; this is known as immediate hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis.

In the case of acute drug-induced urticaria, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis should be made when:
- A delay of less than 2 hours between the introduction of the drug and the appearance of acute urticaria.
- The existence of associated extracutaneous signs of anaphylaxis.
- Resolution of the urticaria within a few hours of stopping the suspected drug.
- Recurrence, which is generally more severe and more rapid, when the suspected drug is re-administered.

### Infectious Urticaria

This is usually acute urticaria resulting from an infection. Many viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, and sometimes vaccinations, can be associated with the onset of urticaria, which is usually acute.",0.8333333333333334,16.72235294117647,False,True,0.7835527062416077,0.7373002568880717,c,False,2,4

**Description:** Knowing the mechanisms of action

**Rubric:** Management

== Definitions ==

**Mechanisms of Action**

Insulin therapy is tailored to each patient as a replacement treatment designed to compensate for insulin deficiency. Insulins reduce blood glucose levels by increasing peripheral uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and reducing its release in the liver. Insulins or insulin analogues are differentiated by their onset and duration of action (rapid, intermediate, or slow). Insulin can be administered by subcutaneous injection (one to four times a day), by external pump (continuously), or sometimes in acute situations by IV injection. Insulin therapy aims to closely reproduce the physiological insulin secretion of the normal pancreas by ensuring that basal insulin levels are stable for 24 hours and that there are three insulin peaks at the time of each of the three meals.

**Indications**

- Diabetes mellitus including type 1 diabetes (insulinopenic), diabetic ketoacidosis
- Type 2 diabetes in pregnant women and type 2 insulin-requiring diabetes (Prescription of medication, follow-up consultation, and education of a patient with type 2 diabetes or secondary diabetes SD-281)

**Side Effects**

- Dose-dependent hypoglycemia (+++) or even hypoglycemic coma in the event of overdose
- Weight gain
- Hypersensitivity (rare)
- Local reactions: erythema, injection site pain, lipodystrophy in the event of repeated injections at the same site
- Hypokalemia with IV insulin (rare)

**Drug Interactions**

- Drugs likely to increase the risk of hypoglycemia: hypoglycemic sulphonamides, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, etc.
- Drugs likely to reduce the hypoglycemic effect: corticosteroids, other immunosuppressants (ciclosporin, tacrolimus), etc.

**Surveillance**

- Daily self-monitoring of blood glucose (2 to 4 times a day, fasting and postprandially) to adapt insulin dosage (use of self-monitoring diary), continuous interstitial blood glucose meter (e.g., FreeStyle Libre 2 type).
- Blood testing of glycated hemoglobin HbA<sub>1C</sub> is carried out every 3 months to assess long-term glycemic control (HbA1c targets are set individually).

AOMI is evoked clinically. It is confirmed in the first instance by measuring pressures: measuring ankle pressures and calculating the IPS.

== Lesion Assessment ==

A morphological and haemodynamic assessment should be carried out to determine the management strategy. Doppler ultrasound of the aorta and arteries of the lower limbs is the reference examination for determining the location of arterial lesions and their haemodynamic impact.

Symptoms guide the choice of further investigations:

- In the case of claudication, a treadmill walking test with measurement of ankle pressures (Strandness test) before and after exercise is used to measure the walking distance. It confirms the arterial origin of the claudication and distinguishes it from differential diagnoses (venous, rheumatological, neurological).

- In the event of symptoms at rest, haemodynamic measurements are essential both to attribute these symptoms to OSA and to quantify the impact of the lesions. They enable the diagnosis of chronic permanent ischaemia to be made:
  - Ankle pressure < 50 mmHg
  - Toe pressure < 30 mmHg
  - TcPO2 < 30 mmHg

The following investigations are not first-line tests:

- Angioscanner of the aorta and arteries of the lower limbs
- Angio-MRI of the aorta and arteries of the lower limbs

**Description:** Know how to explain the risk of recurrence in the event of a new pregnancy depending on the type of trisomy 21

**Rubric:** Management

**Definitions**

The risk of recurrence depends on the karyotype:

- Free, complete, and homogeneous trisomy 21: recurrence risk of approximately 1% unless the mother is over 40 (risk then linked to the mother's age).
- Mosaic trisomy 21: low risk of recurrence.
- Trisomy 21 by translocation: high risk of recurrence if translocation inherited from a parent.
  - Trisomy 21 by Robertsonian translocation (14;21)
    - If of maternal origin: risk of recurrence 10-15%.
    - If of paternal origin: risk of recurrence 2-5%.
  - Trisomy 21 by Robertsonian translocation (21;21)
    - Risk of recurrence: 100% if inherited from a healthy parent (non-viable monosomy 21).

In the case of free trisomy 21, it is not necessary to carry out the parents' karyotype (de novo occurrence, generally due to meiotic non-disjunction).

In the case of trisomy 21 by translocation, it is necessary to carry out karyotyping of the parents. In the event of a balanced anomaly in one parent, the family branch concerned should be further investigated to identify other carriers.

The increased risk of recurrence after the birth of a child with Down's syndrome means that parents can request a foetal karyotype if they wish.

If the parents do not wish to take the risk of miscarriage, prenatal diagnosis (PND) can be offered.

Men with Down's syndrome have reduced fertility. A few pregnancies have been initiated by men with Down's syndrome, and the children did not have trisomy 21. Fertility in women with trisomy 21 is reduced, but pregnancies are possible. The risk of trisomy 21 is around 30% in women with trisomy 21.",0.7272727272727273,13.611538461538462,False,True,0.8684834241867065,0.7271193663279215,c,False,2,4

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Identification of the Emergency

The presence of a prosthetic valve significantly increases the risk of infective endocarditis (IE). Patients with prosthetic heart valves are classified as having a high risk of infection, with the incidence of prosthesis-related IE estimated at around 5% at 5 years.

Early adverse events (AEs) occurring less than one year after implantation result from peri-operative contamination (e.g., catheter, urinary catheter, orotracheal intubation). The germs are mainly from the Staphylococcus family (Coagulase negative or Aureus).

Late infective endocarditis (IE) occurring more than one year after implantation originates from more common routes of entry for IEs (cutaneous, dental, digestive). The germs are similar to those found in AEs on native valves (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus).

Clinical monitoring of patients with valve prostheses is essential. The onset of fever associated with an unknown murmur should alert the clinician. Additionally, any prolonged fever without a warning sign should prompt a search for infective endocarditis.

The diagnostic strategy for adverse reactions (ARs) on prosthetic valves is identical to that for native valves.

Antibiotic treatment is the same as for AEs involving native valves.

The indications for surgery are discussed on a case-by-case basis, with the following conditions being particularly favorable: clinically significant prosthesis dysfunction, uncontrolled infectious syndrome despite antibiotic therapy, presence of an abscess or fistula, and IE caused by Staphylococcus Aureus.

Prevention of AEs for prosthesis wearers depends primarily on clear information being provided to the patient. It is also essential to provide the patient with a valve prosthesis wearer card.

Therapeutic education is crucial, particularly regarding signs that should prompt consultation (e.g., prolonged fever, general malaise). Blood cultures should be taken systematically before any antibiotic treatment.

Dental care should be carried out every 6 months, with scaling and a search for infectious sites. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in cases of dental extraction, periodontal surgery, dental procedures involving manipulation of the apical or gingival region, and any perforation of the oral mucosa.

The antibiotic of choice is Amoxicillin (2g in adults, 50mg/kg in children) 1 hour before the procedure. In the event of allergy, Clindamycin is used (600mg in adults, 20mg/kg in children).",0.8888888888888888,16.662105263157894,False,True,0.7643831968307495,0.6360162297884623,c,True,4,3

Maternal-fetal transmission depends on the gestational age at infection. It increases as pregnancy progresses.

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**

Two main mechanisms lead to hyperuricaemia:  

- A renal and/or intestinal elimination defect.  
- Excess production of uric acid (rare).  

The formation of sodium urate crystals results from chronic hyperuricaemia in excess of 360 ¬µmol/l (60 mg/l), the threshold for saturation of plasma with sodium urate at 35¬∞C (extremity temperature). As this crystallisation phenomenon is reversible, lowering uricemia below this value allows the crystals to dissolve. This value also corresponds to the 'target' uricemia that should be reached after initiation of a hypouricemic treatment.  

The microcrystals of UMS released into the joints are responsible for acute joint attacks and, over time, for the formation of tissue deposits of UMS in clusters, known as gouty tophus. In the urine, the pH can be acidic (below 6), allowing the formation of lithiasis, made up of uric acid in the case of hyperuricuria, which can lead to acute attacks of renal colic, and potential uric nephropathy in the case of chronicity.  

**Gout Classification**

Gout is usually:  

- **Primary:** Familial with a male predominance. Various elements of the metabolic syndrome are frequently associated with gout: obesity with increased abdominal circumference (> 94 cm in European men and 88 cm in women), arterial hypertension, glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia with reduced HDL-cholesterol and hypertriglyceridaemia. Patients with gout should therefore be considered to be at high risk of cardiovascular events, which explains the excess mortality observed. Gout occurring before the age of 35 is possible in 10-15% of cases. It should be investigated for a genetic origin with abnormalities in the genes encoding uric acid transporters in the renal tubules (URAT1, ABCG2).  

- **Secondary to:**  
  - Chronic renal failure, which reduces uric acid excretion.  
  - Several years' use of a drug that reduces urinary uric acid excretion, particularly thiazide diuretics, furosemide or etacrynic acid, acetazolamide, but also cyclosporine, tacrolimus, low-dose aspirin or certain anti-tuberculosis drugs (ethambutol and pyrazinamide).

Social protection is based on:

1. The payment of social benefits directly to individuals. These social benefits can be in cash with replacement income (daily allowances, retirement pensions) or in kind (reimbursement of expenses incurred such as healthcare costs or direct funding of services).

2. Access to social services provided free of charge or at reduced prices (e.g., cr√®ches, canteen meals).

There are six categories of benefits corresponding to various risks:

- **Old Age-Survival Risk**
  - Old age is the most significant risk. It includes pensions, which are the largest part of this risk and social protection. It also covers care for dependency, not yet recognized as a separate risk, despite the introduction of the personalized autonomy allowance (APA) by the law of 20 July 2001, and the National Solidarity Fund for Autonomy, created by the law of 30 June 2004. Additionally, it includes benefits under the minimum old-age pension: the supplementary old-age allowance (ASV) and the solidarity allowance for the elderly (ASPA).
  - Survivors' risk covers needs arising from the death of a family member, usually the spouse.

- **Health Risk**
  - This includes illness, disability, accidents at work, and occupational diseases.

- **Maternity-Family Risk**
  - This includes daily maternity benefits, care for pregnant women, and various family benefits (family allowances, childcare subsidies).

- **Employment Risk**
  - This includes unemployment compensation, aid for vocational rehabilitation and reintegration, and early retirement.

- Human-to-human transmission occurs by air (aerosol) and is highly contagious (R<sub>0</sub> = 15 to 20, meaning one infected person can cause 15 to 20 secondary cases).  
- It is a major cause of infant mortality worldwide, though death is rare in high-income countries.  
- Regular outbreaks of epidemics occur in France.  

**Prevention:**  

- Vaccine prevention through MMR vaccination is compulsory for children under 2 years (at 12 and 16-18 months), with catch-up vaccination if not immune or incomplete for those born after 1980 (2 doses).  
- Around a case, community eviction is recommended 5 days after the start of the rash.  
- Mandatory declaration is required.  

**Clinical Features:**  

- Incubation period is 10-12 days.  
- Contagiousness spans from 5 days before to 5 days after the rash, which is important for case investigation.  
- The disease progresses in two phases:  
  - Invasion (preceding eruption by 2 to 4 days): fever, oculorespiratory catarrh, and Koplik spots (inconstant).  
  - Eruptive (5-6 days): maculopapular rash with intervals of healthy skin, spreading from top to bottom (starts behind the ear, then face, then rest of the body).  

**Complications:**  

- Linked to the virus:  
  - Viral pneumonia  
  - Early acute encephalitis  
  - Late-onset encephalitis (up to 10 years after measles), known as Van Bogaert's subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  

- Linked to bacterial superinfection (persistence or recurrence of fever):  
  - Acute otitis media  
  - Bacterial pneumonia  

- Increased risk of complications before 1 year of age.  

**Signs of Seriousness:**  

- Linked to infection:  
  - Respiratory distress due to lung damage  
  - Neurological issues such as consciousness disorders and convulsions linked to encephalitis  

- Related to impact:  
  - Risk of dehydration in infants  

**Treatment:**  

- Symptomatic treatment  
- Antibiotics if bacterial superinfection is present  

**Case Management Around a Case (CAT):**  

- **Adults:**  
  - Check status: disease or vaccine. Vaccination within 3 days if not immune or incomplete vaccination according to recommendations (2 doses if born after 1980 or if healthcare or early childhood staff regardless of date of birth).  

- **Pregnant Women or Immunosuppressed Individuals:**  
  - Vaccination is contraindicated. Administer IV polyvalent immunoglobulin (200 mg/kg) if non-immune, and perform emergency serology if in doubt.  

- **Children:**  
  - **< 6 months:**  
    - If the mother is immune: no action needed (baby protected by maternal antibodies).  
    - If the mother is not immune: administer IVIG within 6 days of contact (then wait 9 months before starting vaccination).  

  - **6 to 11 months:**  
    - If seen within 3 days: administer vaccination (this does not count in the calendar, so repeat doses according to the calendar at 12 and 16-18 months).  
    - If seen after 3 days and before 6 days: administer IVIG (followed by a 9-month delay before starting vaccination).  

  - **12 months and over:**  
    - Update the vaccination schedule according to recommendations.",1.0,8.009090909090911,False,True,0.7244202494621277,0.6613906820615133,c,False,5,3

### Intracranial Hypertension Syndromes (HTIC)

- **Headache:** In the form of a helmet, diffuse, intense, morning, wakes the patient at the end of the night, exaggerated by coughing/exertion/decubitus, resistant to analgesics. Progressive onset (sometimes abrupt). With vomiting (inconstant; effortless, in spurts and temporarily relieves the headache). The headache precedes disorders of vigilance (obnubilation, confusion, then coma). Other symptoms include horizontal diplopia (VI uni or bilateral), visual eclipses (transient bilateral amaurosis, late), bilateral papilledema at the fundus. In infants: fontanel bulge, increased PC.

### Intracranial Hypotension Syndromes

- **Post-dural puncture headache:** A few hours after an iatrogenic dural breach (LP, epidural, spinal anesthesia, etc.), progressive (sometimes sudden). Postural orthostatic headache which appears when standing or sitting, and disappears in less than 15 minutes when lying flat without a cushion. With nausea, sometimes vomiting, cervicalgia (in standing position).
- **Spontaneous intracranial hypotension headache:** Orthostatic postural headache in the absence of iatrogenic dural rupture.

### Acute Post-Traumatic Headache

- By definition appears less than 7 days after a head injury and may resemble a migraine or tension headache. The possibility of a more serious secondary headache (extradural hematoma, subdural hematoma, cervical artery dissection) must be systematically raised and ruled out by appropriate imaging (Item 334).

### Giant Cell Arteritis (Item 195)

- Any unusual headache in a subject >50 years of age should raise the suspicion of giant cell arteritis (Horton's disease), even in the absence of the classic picture (AEG, limb-girdle pain, bitemporal pain, indurated, warm, non-throbbing temporal artery, jaw claudication).

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis

The diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is based essentially on questioning, rarely on the observation of an attack, and sometimes on examination of a photograph taken by the patient.

**RP is characterized by phases of extremity color change (typically 3 phases):**

- A syncopal phase with whitening of the distal fingers, insensitivity, and sometimes pain: the most frequent and obligatory phase for diagnosing RP.
- Sometimes followed by an asphyxia phase (cyanotic fingers, dysaesthesia).
- Sometimes followed by a hyperaemic phase with painful redness.

**The diagnosis of erythromelalgia is clinical and based on crises of:**

- Pain in the extremities (most often the feet), such as cooking or burning pain, with redness and increased skin temperature.
- Triggered by heat, exercise, or orthostatism.
- Relief by cold, rest, or elevation of the limb.
- Increased skin heat during attacks.
- Sensitivity to aspirin.

**Acrocyanosis** is painless and is often accompanied by hyperhidrosis. It most often begins in adolescence (essential acrocyanosis, which represents the vast majority of acrocyanoses). It is more common in people of light build. It most often affects both hands and feet, symmetrically.

**Frostbite** is characterized by oedematous, pruritic, and sometimes allergic, erythrocyanotic papules, usually bilateral (toes, more rarely fingers), which occur when the skin is cold and damp. The pruritic nature is particularly suggestive, and localized digital oedema is often associated. The disease progresses by flare-ups lasting 2 to 3 weeks with spontaneous recovery in spring and possible seasonal relapses. It may be complicated by haemorrhagic bullae and exulcerations. The first symptoms usually appear in adolescence and are predominantly female. There are no visceral or biological manifestations.

**Definitions**

Since the bioethics law of August 2021, a PGM technique can be performed for:

- A couple made up of a living man and woman, a couple made up of two women, or an unmarried woman.
- According to the age criteria mentioned below:
  - Gamete retrieval for the purposes of MAP (IVF/ICSI):
    - Until the woman's 43rd birthday
    - Until the spouse's 60th birthday
  - IUI, use of gametes or germ tissue for reproductive purposes, and embryo transfer may be carried out:
    - Until the 45th birthday of the woman who is to carry the child
    - Until the 60th birthday of the member of the couple who is not intended to carry the child
- Consent to the embryo transfer or insemination must be obtained beforehand (a consent form must be signed by both members of the couple or the unmarried woman).

Gametes can be stored for non-medical reasons:

- For women: from age 29 and before age 37
- For men: from age 29 and before age 45

The costs covered by the Assurance Maladie include:

- Medical exploration of fertility
- Treatments prescribed during the course of MAP treatment
- 6 IUI attempts
- 4 IVF-c or ICSI attempts (an attempt includes stimulation, obtaining and in vitro culture of the embryos, transfer of the embryo(s) obtained immediately after puncture or after freezing and thawing).

In the event of a pregnancy following an MPA technique, the number of attempts (IUI and IVF+/-ICSI) is reset to zero for the Assurance Maladie if the couple or unmarried woman wishes to have a new child using MPA.

It is necessary for the couple or the unmarried woman to use all the frozen embryos before making any further attempts.

Every year, couples or unmarried women with retained embryos are consulted as to whether they wish to continue with their parental project. If the couple separates, or if they do not wish to continue with their parental project, they may request that the embryos be destroyed, or that they be transferred to research or to another couple.

**Gamete or Embryo Donation**

Gamete or embryo donation is carried out in a public or not-for-profit establishment authorized for these activities, mainly in an egg and sperm study and conservation center (CECOS). This involves the intervention of a third-party donor of spermatozoa or oocytes or a donation of embryos with a view to their reception (preserved as part of IVF-c or ICSI, for which there is no longer a parental project). The couple benefiting from a gamete or embryo donation is referred to as the ""recipient couple"".

The conditions for access to third-party donor MPA are identical to those for intraconjugal MPA.

The main principles of the donation are as follows:

- Voluntary: Donation is carried out freely, after the donor has signed a written consent form with the medical team authorized to carry out the donation, and the recipient couple has signed it with a notary.
- Free of charge: No payment in return, but expenses incurred by the donation are covered.
- Anonymity: Donors and recipients do not have access to their respective identities. Since the Bioethics Act of 2021, children born from a donation will have the right, when they come of age, to request, if they wish, the identifying and non-identifying data of the donor (sperm, oocytes, embryos).

The number of children born from the same donor is limited to 10.

Donors may be single or a couple.

Donors are not required to have had children prior to donation.

**Concerning Fertility Preservation**

The consent of the patient or of the holder of parental authority if the patient is a minor is obtained prior to the gametes or germ tissue being preserved. The consent of both members of the couple is obtained if embryo conservation is envisaged. Every year, he/she is asked whether he/she wishes to continue or stop gamete or germ tissue preservation. All fertility preservation techniques are currently reimbursed at 100% by the French Assurance Maladie, in accordance with the conditions set out above.

It should be noted that MAP treatment and recourse to fertility preservation are carried out after multidisciplinary consultation between the doctors and reproductive biologists of the MAP center carrying out the procedure.",0.8333333333333334,15.403333333333332,False,True,0.7798526287078857,0.6344510316848755,b,False,3,3

**Title:** Knowing the Main Complications of Surgical and Medicinal Abortion  
**Description:** Immediate, Secondary, and Long-term Complications  

== Immediate Complications ==

### Pain
Ibuprofen should be prescribed as the first-line treatment. The dose is 400 to 600 mg, to be repeated if necessary, without exceeding 1,200 mg/24 h. Paracetamol with codeine may be an alternative. Paracetamol alone and phloroglucinol are not recommended. The duration of treatment may vary from a few hours to a few days.

For the instrumental method, NSAIDs are recommended to limit intraoperative and postoperative pain. A dose of 600 mg ibuprofen can be administered pre-operatively.

""Abnormal pelvic pain (SD-099)."" ""Prescribing analgesics (SD-250)."" ""Prevention of pain associated with care (SD-258)."" ""Assessment and management of acute pain (SD-259).""

### Failure
Complete failure is defined by a progressive pregnancy. The risk of complete failure in the case of instrumental abortion is exceptional (1 to 5 ‚Ä∞). The rate of progressive pregnancy after medical abortion is 1%.

Partial failure is defined as an incomplete abortion. It is more frequent in the case of medical abortion. Two solutions may then be proposed:
- Instrumental suction
- Misoprostol per os

### Mechanics
Specific to the instrumental method:
- Cervical tears in 0.2 to 1% of cases
- Uterine perforation: 1 to 4 per 1000 operations

### Haemorrhage
The risk of haemorrhage after an abortion is 1%, with a transfusion risk of 0.1%. This risk is greater in the case of medically induced abortion.

""Abnormal genital bleeding (SD-111)."" ""Acute haemorrhage (SD-060)."" ""Palpitation (SD-165)."" ""Tachycardia (SD-166).""

### Infectious Infections
The risk of upper genital infection is around 1% after an instrumental abortion and 0.3% after a medicated abortion. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended only in the case of instrumental abortion. Particular attention should be paid to the clinical inflammatory syndrome after abortion, whatever the technique, so as not to overlook a type A Streptococcus pyogenes infection.

### Deaths
The risk of death due to abortion is of the same order as that due to spontaneous miscarriage (0.7 per 100,000).

== Secondary Complications ==
These are uterine arteriovenous malformations (UAVM). The persistence of ovarian tissue after a medicated or instrumental abortion can lead to a failure to resorb the peritrophoblastic vascularisation and the creation of a UAVM. The treatment for these complications is embolisation by interventional radiology in the event of haemorrhage.

== Long-term Complications ==
After one or more abortions, there is no increased risk of:
- Infertility
- SCC, except where the interval between the abortion and the subsequent pregnancy is < 3 months
- EP
- Placental anomalies
- Premature delivery
- An increase in psychiatric disorders
- Adenomyosis

- If the clinical picture strongly suggests cord torsion, further investigation is not indicated.
- A strong clinical suspicion of spermatic cord torsion may delay emergency surgical management if imaging is pursued.
- Testicular ultrasound with Doppler is crucial in cases of acute bursal disease, especially after 24 hours. The study is compared with the contralateral testicle. Diagnosis of spermatic cord torsion can be challenging.

The DSM-5 definition distinguishes between minor (mild) and major neuro-cognitive disorders according to their impact on the patient's functional independence.

**Minor Cognitive Impairment**

- Presence of moderate cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or more domains of cognition (complex attention, executive functions, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on:
  - Cognitive deficits do not interfere with autonomy in daily life (i.e., instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) such as paying bills or taking medication are preserved, but require greater effort, compensatory strategies, or adjustment).
  - Cognitive deficits do not only occur in the context of delirium (confusional syndrome in French terminology).
  - Cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive episode, schizophrenia).

**Major Neurocognitive Disorder**

- Presence of significant cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or more domains of cognition (complex attention, executive functions, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on:
  - Cognitive decline affects autonomy in daily activities (i.e., requires at least assistance with complex instrumental activities such as paying bills or managing medication).
  - Cognitive deficits do not only occur in the context of delirium (confusional syndrome in French terminology).

== Definitions ==

== Infectious illness: purpura fulminans ==

Purpura fulminans is characterized by:

- Rapid extension (within minutes or hours) in size and number of a vascular purpura, with at least one necrotic or ecchymotic element over 3 mm in diameter, associated with sepsis or septic shock.
- Most often secondary to bacterial meningococcal or pneumococcal infection, which may (but not always) be part of infectious meningitis.

Clinical signs indicative of purpura fulminans include:

- Fever (hyperthermia/fever)
- Signs of haemodynamic failure (hypotension, mottling, polypnoea, collapse, oligoanuria, etc.)
- Neurological signs (obnubilation, coma, meningeal syndrome). Note that the meningeal syndrome may be absent.
- Necrotic and/or ecchymotic and/or extensive purpura (physical examination to be carried out with the patient in underwear).

Vital prognosis is at stake (death in 20% of cases under treatment) and treatment is urgent and hospital-based. It consists of:

- As a matter of urgency, and before any examination: intra-muscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) injection of antibiotics (preferably 3rd generation cephalosporin: cefotaxime or ceftriaxone).
- Perform blood cultures (if possible and without delaying the injection of the first dose of antibiotic).
- Carry out a biological check-up.
- The use of droplet precautions (surgical mask) during treatment.

Lumbar puncture is contraindicated until the coagulation disorder has been corrected.

== Haemorrhagic emergency: profound thrombocytopenia ==

Profound thrombocytopenia is defined as a circulating platelet count of less than 20,000 platelets/mm¬≥ and is associated with a significant and serious risk of haemorrhage (acute haemorrhage).

Signs of seriousness to look for include:

- Purpura of the mucous membranes: haemorrhagic bullae of the mucous membranes (endo-buccal), gingivorrhagia reflecting a high risk of haemorrhage.
- Epistaxis, macroscopic haematuria.
- Meno-metrorrhagia (abnormal genital bleeding excluding known pregnancy).
- Digestive haemorrhage (melena/rectorrhagia, haematemesis, blood emission through mouth).
- Signs suggesting intracranial bleeding (headache, confusion, coma, focal deficit, convulsive seizure).

---

A nephrological aetiology is considered if the urological work-up is negative and/or if there is a suggestive nephrological syndrome (highly suggestive associated proteinuria, hypertension, renal failure), or a personal or family history suggestive of hematuric nephropathy.

### A. Glomerular Nephropathy

To be considered if the hematuria is associated with glomerular proteinuria, hypertension, and renal failure, confirmed by renal biopsy:

- **Acquired Recurrent Macroscopic Hematuria Syndrome:** Suggestive of primary IgA nephropathy (mostly in young men: macroscopic hematuria 48 hours after an episode of ENT infection) or congenital: Alport syndrome (family background, deafness, ophthalmological involvement).
- In children, persistent microscopic hematuria should prompt a search for a glomerular cause:
  - Alport syndrome: microscopic or macroscopic hematuria.
  - Acute nephritic syndrome: acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis.

**Acute Nephritic Syndrome:** Most often post-infectious GN (10-15 days after streptococcal ENT infection), hypocomplementemia.

**Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN):** Rapid deterioration in renal function with glomerular syndrome (proteinuria + hematuria) with extra-renal signs revealing systemic disease or vasculitis.

### B. Acute Interstitial Nephropathy

Most often immuno-allergic (often drug-induced), it may combine hematuria with leucocyturia and renal failure, along with signs of the allergic series (skin rash, cytolysis, etc.).

### C. Nephrological Causes with Urological Clinical Presentation

Hematuria due to invasion of the urinary tree, responsible for lumbar pain:

- **Papillary Necrosis:** Migration of papillary fragments into the ureter, mimicking nephritic colic, on a favorable background (diabetes, sickle cell anemia, use of NSAIDs, etc.).
- **Renal Infarction:** Hematuria with sudden lumbar pain, requiring emergency treatment if it involves the main trunk of the renal artery. Causes include thromboembolic or vascular disease, sickle cell disease, or post-trauma.
- **Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD):** Development of renal cysts in which the vessels in the wall may rupture, causing hematuria.

- Sudden onset of acute respiratory distress associated with an increase in left ventricular filling pressure.
- Cardiogenic insult leads to a sudden increase in left ventricular filling pressures. This increase in LV pressure is associated with an increase in pressure in the left atrium and pulmonary capillaries (> 25 mmHg). This pressure is higher than the interstitial oncotic pressure and results in the formation of a transudate in the pulmonary alveoli. The alveoli are ""flooded,"" and haematosis is altered.

**Remarks:**

- OAP results in impaired gas exchange leading to hypoxaemia.
- It is associated with a compensatory mechanism resulting in hyperventilation, leading initially to hypocapnia.

## Diagnosis of Death Prior to Removal from a Deceased Person

The definition of death is the result of a social agreement, which varies over time. Historically, death was recognized through the inanimate or cold corpse. Later, the notion of death due to cardiac arrest emerged, followed by encephalic death.

In 1959, Mollaret and Goulon defined encephalic death, but it was not officially recognized until 1968 in the circular legalizing the removal of organs from a subject in a state of encephalic death (the Jeanneney circular).

Today, there are two recognized ways of being dead, as stated in Decree no. 96-1041 of 2 December 1996 on the determination of death prior to the removal of organs, tissues, and cells for therapeutic or scientific purposes:

1. **Patient in Cardiac Arrest (Clinical Criteria):**
   - Absence of consciousness and spontaneous motor activity with no response to stimulation.
   - Abolition of all brain stem reflexes.
   - Absence of spontaneous ventilation.
   - In this case, samples must be taken rapidly.

2. **Patient in a State of Encephalic Death:**
   - No spontaneous ventilation in hypercapnia test.
   - Two EEGs with no detectable activity 4 hours apart, each recorded for at least 30 minutes, and/or cerebral angiography showing the absence of effective circulation.
   - In these cases, sampling may be deferred, and the dead body maintained in a circulatory and ventilatory state to preserve the quality of the organs. This condition is an important source of organs, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the context of a donation policy.

It is important to be familiar with the Maastricht classification and the questions it raises:

- People in circulatory arrest, declared dead on admission (Maastricht category I).
- People in circulatory arrest with effective cardiac massage and mechanical ventilation, but without recovery of circulatory activity (Maastricht category II).
- People for whom a decision has been taken to limit or stop treatment due to the prognosis of the pathologies that led to their admission to intensive care (Maastricht category III).
- People who have died of brain death and suffered irreversible circulatory arrest during intensive care (Maastricht category IV).

Encephalic death is little known to the general public; it conveys complex emotional representations for relatives because the body is ventilated and moving. Additionally, there is a fear that the body will be removed when there is still a chance of life. It is crucial to be clear with family and friends and establish death as a real, irreversible state. Listening, explaining, and supporting them is essential. There is a strong need for educational clarification on two levels: firstly, prior to any death, for all citizens and the general public, and secondly, at the time of death, for the next of kin.

## A Special Case: Organ Donation and the Medico-Legal Obstacle

- If there is a ""medico-legal obstacle"" at the time of death, this is not an obstacle or a prohibition on organ removal.
- However:
  - Agreement of the Public Prosecutor is required (role of the forensic pathologist is crucial).
  - The donation process can sometimes be compatible with the medical-legal process.
  - The removal(s) with a view to donation must not involve areas or organs necessary for the expert assessment of the autopsy.
  - The question of proof and justice takes precedence over the logic of donation.",0.6666666666666666,15.420000000000002,False,True,0.752926230430603,0.7271673878033956,c,False,2,4

The particularities compared to adult athletes are:

- During the clinical examination, particular attention is paid to spinal statics to detect any growth disorders.

- The need to assess the overall amount of physical activity children do each week, considering all types of activity (school sport, school sports associations, sports clubs). Children who practice intensively (>6 hours/week before the age of 10 or more than 10 hours/week after the age of 10) have a higher risk of developing sports-related pathologies (""Knowing the main pathologies linked to sport in children (2C-256-ET-B01)"").

- When the child practices intensively, the need to assess:
  - The impact of the sport on living conditions and learning at school (distance and travel time between training, home, and school)
  - His average sleep time
  - The quality of the child's diet (""Nutritional requirements of sports children (2C-256-PC-B04)"") and any dietary supplements used

- To take part in a sports competition if the patient is not a member of a sports federation

This medical certificate must be less than one year old on the day of application for the federal licence or registration for the competition.

Any medical doctor can draw up this certificate, which states that there are no contraindications to practising the sport, in competition where applicable, and mentions the contraindicated discipline(s) where appropriate.

If a sports patient renews their licence with the same federation from one year to the next, the medical certificate is only required every three years. During the two intervening years, the athlete can obtain a licence by certifying to his or her federation that he or she has answered NO to each of the sections of the ""QS-SPORT"" health questionnaire available online.

Certain sports involving special constraints (mountaineering, underwater diving, speleology, combat sports with knockouts, sports using firearms, sports using motor vehicles, sports using aircraft, rugby with 15, 13 or 7 players) require specific medical examinations (cardiological, ENT, dental, neurological, ophthalmological, cervical spine, etc.).

Since 2021, underage athletes no longer need to produce a medical certificate if the athlete and the persons with parental authority certify to the sports federation that they have answered NO to each section of the health questionnaire available online.",0.2857142857142857,15.810000000000002,False,True,0.8116275668144226,0.7704423268636068,d,False,4,4

**Title:** Knowing How to Determine the Duration of Anticoagulant Treatment (Proximal DVT and PE)

**Description:** None

**Definitions:**

Duration of anticoagulant treatment with heparins or oral anticoagulants (VKA and AOD) and monitoring methods.

A minimum of 3 months' anticoagulant treatment is recommended in cases of proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism. Beyond 3 months, the decision to prolong anticoagulant treatment depends on the circumstances and the benefit/risk ratio between thrombo-embolic recurrence and hemorrhage.

**In Practice:**

- The duration of treatment for proximal DVT and PE is identical.
- Proximal DVT or PE with a strong identified transient favoring factor: 3 to 6 months' treatment.
- Unprovoked proximal DVT or PE: at least 6 months' treatment, with prolonged treatment discussed on a case-by-case basis (with no predetermined end date).
- Recurrent proximal DVT or unprovoked PE: prolonged treatment.
- Proximal DVT or PE and cancer: treatment as long as the cancer is active (tumor present, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, etc.).
- Proximal DVT or PE and pregnancy: at least 3 months' treatment, including the first 6 weeks postpartum.
- PE associated with chronic post-embolic pulmonary heart disease: long-term treatment.

In all cases, during prolonged treatment, it is essential to regularly re-evaluate the benefit/risk ratio of the treatment between thrombo-embolic recurrence and hemorrhage and to consider the patient's preference regarding the treatment. Adaptation to particular conditions such as renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, pregnancy, or elderly patients is necessary.

A follow-up venous Doppler ultrasound is systematically carried out at the end of anticoagulant treatment to determine the sequelae.

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Management  

**Management Guidelines:**

- In cases of acute retention of urine due to clotting macroscopic hematuria, and in the absence of retention of urine or renal colic, it is advisable to maintain good hydration to allow the evacuation of clots and eliminate reversible favoring factors such as hemostasis disorders and anticoagulants.

- A full blood test must be carried out, including CBC, TP/TCA +/- INR, and ABO Rh group RAI.

- In the event of associated hemodynamic problems, intravenous filling should be started, and transfusion of packed red blood cells should be considered in the event of poorly tolerated deglobulation. Hemostasis disorders must be corrected simultaneously, which may involve discontinuation of an anticoagulant, correction of an overdose, or supplementation with vitamin K or PPSB.

- In case of urine retention due to bladder clotting:
  - Placement of a suprapubic catheter (KT) is contraindicated due to the risk of dissemination in case of an unrecognized underlying bladder urothelial tumor and the impossibility of unblocking and continuous bladder cleansing, which poses a risk of obstruction of the KT (insufficient caliber).
  - Placement of a double-stream bladder catheter (large bore CH>18) is recommended, with manual decapping using a syringe followed by continuous irrigation/washing with physiological saline. An ECBU is performed when the catheter is inserted.

- If manual decalcification fails, if the transfusion yield is poor, or if the patient is clinically unwell, endoscopic surgical decalcification should be considered in the operating theatre. This procedure may allow a bladder lesion to be treated or resected simultaneously.

- In cases of macroscopic hematuria originating in the upper excretory tract, clotting may lead to renal colic, which is usually self-limiting. It may sometimes be necessary to insert a ureteral stent in cases of obstructive pyelonephritis, renal failure, or resistant renal pain.",1.0,17.28315789473685,False,True,0.8335279226303101,0.6404128273328146,c,False,4,3

**Rubric:** Management

# Drugs Affecting the Renin-Angiotensin System: Mechanisms of Action, Indications, Side-Effects, Drug Interactions, Monitoring Procedures, and Main Causes of Failure

## Renin-Angiotensin System Drugs

### Two Classes of Drugs

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, INN ""-pril"" or ""-prilate"".
- Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, INN ""-sartan"".

## Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action involves the inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and the increase in concentrations of bradykinin. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists act as competitive inhibitors of angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub> receptors.

## Indications

### Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors

- All: Hypertension
- Most: Heart failure with systolic dysfunction
- Some: Proteinuric glomerular nephropathy
- Some: Recent post-myocardial infarction
- Ramipril: Prevention of cardiovascular morbidity in atheromatous or diabetic patients with risk factors

### Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists

- All: Arterial hypertension
- Candesartan, losartan, and valsartan: Heart failure with systolic dysfunction in cases of contraindication or intolerance to ACE inhibitors.
- Irbesartan, losartan: Proteinuric diabetic nephropathy with hypertension
- Valsartan: Recent post-myocardial infarction
- Telmisartan: Prevention of cardiovascular morbidity in atheromatous or diabetic patients with target organ damage

## Adverse Reactions

### Common

- Orthostatic or non-orthostatic hypotension, frequent, take care when taking for the first time.
- Hyperkalaemia, rare, most often in cases of renal failure.
- Acute renal failure, rare, reversible
- Angioneurotic oedema, rare, more frequent with ACE inhibitors (0.1 to 0.5%)
- Foetotoxicity, very serious, exceptional (pregnancy absolute contraindication)

### Specific to ACE Inhibitors

- Dry cough, frequent (5-20% on ACE inhibitors), stops after treatment is stopped

## Drug Interactions

- Potassium salts: Combination not recommended, risk of hyperkalaemia.
- Potassium-sparing diuretics: Risk of hyperkalaemia, combination not recommended except for spironolactone and eplerenone in heart failure. In the latter case, combination under strict control of kalaemia and renal function.
- Lithium: Combination not recommended, risk of increased lithaemia due to increased proximal tubular reabsorption.
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Combination not recommended, increased risk of renal failure and hyperkalaemia.
- Loop diuretics and thiazides: Caution in use, risk of arterial hypotension and/or acute renal failure in the event of hydrosodic depletion.

## Contraindications

- Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Absolute contraindication for both classes.
- Bilateral renal artery stenosis.
- Angioneurotic oedema with ACE inhibitors.
- Renal insufficiency is not a contraindication, but requires precautions (monitoring of blood pressure, glomerular function, and kalaemia).

## Monitoring Procedures

- In the event of activation of the renin-angiotensin system, there is a significant risk of severe arterial hypotension, necessitating correction of associated factors and prescription of moderate, progressive doses, under clinical (blood pressure) and biological (kalaemia, creatininaemia) supervision. Classic situations include heart failure, intensive treatment with diuretics, severe de-sodorisation, hypovolaemia, diarrhoea, or vomiting.
- In patients whose renal function depends mainly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is a risk of severe arterial hypotension and acute renal failure. Classic situations include severe congestive heart failure, underlying renal damage, or rare bilateral renal artery stenosis.
- Most of these drugs are eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Consequently, in cases of renal insufficiency, dosage should be adapted to glomerular function and biological monitoring (kalaemia, creatininaemia) should be closely monitored.
- Anaesthesia: Interruption of treatment is recommended the day before the operation due to the increased risk of arterial hypotension.
- Injection of iodinated contrast products increases the risk of acute renal failure, and it is advisable to interrupt treatment 24 hours beforehand.",0.6666666666666666,20.150000000000002,False,True,0.6949009895324707,0.48882516225179035,c,False,3,4

The management of errors and complaints; therapeutic hazards.

**Title:** Knowing the definition of disciplinary liability.

**Rubric:** Definition.

**Definitions**

Disciplinary liability is incurred before the bodies of the Ordre des M√©decins. Disciplinary action is independent of any other action that may be taken against a doctor, whether civil or criminal.

**Misconduct and Disciplinary Sanctions**

**Disciplinary Offences**

Any breach of the rules of medical ethics constitutes a disciplinary offence. It is a violation of a moral rule rather than a strictly legal rule, whether or not it is enshrined in a text such as the Code of Medical Ethics. In principle, such misconduct is related to professional activity, but not exclusively. An act in private life may be prejudicial to the honour or morality of the profession. The rules governing medical ethics are set out in the Code of Medical Ethics (articles R.4127-1 to R.4127-112 of the Public Health Code). The fundamental principles it contains apply to all doctors registered with the Ordre des M√©decins, as well as to medical interns performing locums.

This Code differs from the Penal Code, which does not set out principles but rather lists behaviours prohibited by our society (criminal offences). It is drawn up by the Conseil national de l'Ordre des m√©decins, which is vested with regulatory powers that are subject to the Conseil d'Etat. It is revised periodically, as it must comply with the law.

**Disciplinary Sanctions**

The penalties incurred include:
- A warning.
- A reprimand.
- A temporary ban from performing any duties remunerated by the State or public authorities.
- A temporary ban from practising (for a maximum of three years).
- Removal from the roll of the Ordre.

Temporary disqualifications may be accompanied by a suspended sentence (partial or total), which may be revoked if a new disciplinary offence is committed within the following five years. If the ban is lifted, the person concerned may ask for it to be lifted again after three years. If this is refused, they must wait three years before applying again.

**Implementation of Disciplinary Liability**

**Jurisdictions**

The competent courts are the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's regional council and, on appeal, the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's national council. Appeals may be lodged with the Conseil d'Etat.

**Referral**

Referrals may be made to the disciplinary chamber of the regional council of the Ordre for self-employed doctors by:
- A departmental council of the Ordre.
- The national council of the Ordre.
- A doctor.
- A doctors' union.
- The director of the regional health agency.
- The prefect.
- The public prosecutor.
- The minister responsible for health.

For doctors working in the public hospital sector, the power to refer cases is limited to:
- The Conseil d√©partemental de l'Ordre.
- The Conseil national de l'Ordre.
- The Director of the Regional Health Agency.
- The Prefect.
- The Public Prosecutor.
- The Minister for Health.

A patient's complaint against a private practitioner or hospital doctor must be referred to the Conseil d√©partemental de l'Ordre, which is obliged to attempt conciliation. If this fails, the Conseil d√©partemental de l'Ordre is obliged to forward the complaint to the disciplinary chamber of the Conseil r√©gional de l'Ordre.

**Procedure**

The patient is one of the parties to the proceedings, so he or she is entitled to appeal (recours, pourvoi en cassation) and may be accompanied by a lawyer. The doctor, for his part, may be assisted before the court by a lawyer from the bar or a colleague.

**Title:** Knowing the indication for carrying out a multi-allergen IgE screening test (aeroallergens and trophallergens)

**Description:** None

The multiallergenic test is prescribed by the primary care physician. It is prescribed for patients when questioning points to a respiratory or food allergy, and when an allergist cannot be consulted for several months.

The aim is to detect IgE antibodies specific to a panel of allergens most commonly encountered in the immediate type of allergy.

**In case of suspected respiratory allergy:**

- Tests with mixtures of pneumallergens: Phadiatop¬Æ, Alatop¬Æ, Allergyscreen¬Æ.

**In the event of a suspected food allergy:**

- Tests with trophallergen mixtures: Trophatop¬Æ (children or adults, see ""paediatric specialities"" below)

It is not necessary to be fasting or to have stopped taking antihistamines before the sample is taken.

The answer is only qualitative (positive or negative).

**Warning:** A positive multi-allergen test does not mean allergy. If exposure to the allergen detected as positive is well tolerated, there is no allergy (e.g., positive specific IgE to peanuts, even though the patient eats peanuts without any problem, means sensitisation and not allergy). This is important because it is not necessary to avoid the food in this case, or it may cause a long-term allergy to this food (break in tolerance).

Multi-allergenic tests can also detect atopy with very good sensitivity (>90%).",0.4,14.142222222222227,False,True,0.8341362476348877,0.6939032872517904,b,False,2,3

**Rubric:** Management  

Withdrawal remains beneficial at all stages of pregnancy. The general principles of withdrawal are the same as outside pregnancy.

Appropriate nicotine replacement therapy is often necessary to help pregnant women give up smoking. To adapt the dosage, dependence on nicotine should be assessed prior to pregnancy using the Fagerstr√∂m questionnaire, and sometimes the level of intoxication should be measured by means of exhaled CO (CO analyzer).

Medical interventions to help people stop smoking are essentially individualized aids. There are several types:

- Advice and information tailored to the smoker's motivation and history, delivered to the patient using a variety of media: factsheets, electronic resources, or telephone calls.
- Information given to the woman on her level of smoking by objective measurement (CO analyzer).
- Psychological and/or behavioral approaches:
  - Minimal advice on quitting: asking about smoking status, whether there is a plan to quit, and providing a simple written document on the subject.
  - Brief intervention: involves probing the interview with open-ended questions.
  - Motivational interviewing: seeks out and highlights the patient's personal motivations for considering or building up withdrawal.
  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy: involves developing practical ways of getting around and overcoming cravings.
  - Psychological consultation.
  - Addictology consultation in the case of associated drug use.
- Nicotine prescription given to the patient in the event of pharmacological dependence.
- Other interventions that have been evaluated include hypnosis.

**Diagnostic Approach to Hypotonic Hyponatremia:**

1. **Rule Out Non-Hypo-Osmotic Hyponatremia:**
   - Hyponatremia with normal or elevated plasma osmolality (measured using an osmometer):
     - Factitious hyponatremia in cases of hyperproteinemia and hyperlipidemia.
     - Hyponatremia during major hyperglycemia or intoxication by methanol or ethanol, leading to intracellular dehydration and plasma hyperosmolality.

2. **Assess Urinary Osmolality:**
   - Determine if kidneys are appropriately diluting urine in the context of hyponatremia (Uosm < 100 mOsm/kg H2O).

3. **Clinical Assessment of Extracellular Compartment and Effective Blood Volume:**
   - Provides information on sodium balance:
     - **Extracellular Dehydration:** Lack of NaCl intake, digestive, cutaneous, or renal loss of NaCl.
     - **Isolated Intracellular Hyperhydration:** SIADH or potomania.
     - **Global Hyperhydration:** Often due to heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome, causing volo-dependent ADH stimulation by effective hypovolemia. May also be due to advanced renal failure.

**SIADH Diagnostic Criteria:**

- Posm < 275 mOsm/kg
- Uosm > 100 mOsm/kg (in hyponatremic conditions)
- Clinical euvolemia
- UNa > 30 mmol/L (with normal sodium and water intake)

The functional prognosis is linked to the chronic, low-noise evolution of occlusive vascular lesions in the absence of medical treatment. These lead to an increase in ischaemia, the appearance of permanent critical ischaemia, and trophic disorders. If the diagnosis is made too late, it may be impossible to revascularize the lower limb, and amputations may be necessary.

== Acute Limb Ischaemia ==

Acute limb ischaemia can also be very sudden, with the onset of intense pain (SD-071).

It is a medico-surgical emergency: it threatens the patient's vital prognosis and/or the functional prognosis of the limb.

It requires rapid treatment in a specialized facility.

Despite appropriate treatment, the overall prognosis remains poor. Acute ischaemia is associated with 10% of deaths, 25% of amputations, 15% of sequelae, and only 50% of good results.",0.8,9.44923076923077,False,True,0.7714075446128845,0.6251017649968466,c,False,4,4

**Title:** Right and Duty to Inform  
**Description:** Acknowledge the duty to inform and the right of patients to be informed about their state of health and all medical acts (medical confidentiality is not enforceable against patients themselves).  
**Rubric:** Care  

== Informing is a Major Art ==  
In practice, this process must be carried out in such a way as to enable the patient to understand it and to ensure that it does not cause anxiety. In clinical practice, we sometimes experience the difficulty of providing information, particularly when faced with highly distressed patients, where the truth is difficult to tell and some patients are unable to bear it. Some former doctors used to quote St Thomas to justify not informing a patient: ""Man prefers a lie to the truth. Man prefers a lie to the truth that enlightens."" But apart from exceptional cases, this type of approach is a thing of the past. We believe that every patient has the right to know, so that they can participate in the organization of their care pathway, but also so that they can organize their lives accordingly, in terms of both day-to-day aspects and fundamental choices. Providing information is a complex process but, like any medical skill, it can be learned. This learning process includes both the way in which the information is delivered and the way in which the patient is supported during the process, with a humanistic and psychological approach.

The law gives this development an additional dimension by placing information and consent within a contractual framework designed to assess the quality of medical practice, particularly in the event of conflict. Questions of the quality and completeness of information are part of this framework.

However, a rare case should be mentioned: the wish not to know. This may constitute an exception to the patient's duty to inform if he or she has clearly expressed (data and arguments which must be noted in the medical record) the wish to be kept in the dark about a serious diagnosis or prognosis, or even about any information concerning his or her health and treatment. However, legal and ethical rules specify that this exception does not apply when third parties are exposed to a risk of contamination. This clarification, inspired by the case of AIDS, applies to all serious contagious diseases and is necessary because of the patient's responsibility towards others and in the interests of public health.

== How Far to Inform: The Question of Serious or Exceptional Risks ==  
Two types of situations may arise in medical practice, depending on whether or not there is a choice between different diagnostic and/or therapeutic hypotheses.

In the most frequent case where a treatment recognized and validated by medicine is proposed to the exclusion of all other options, the primary aim of the information provided is not to make a therapeutic choice (unless the patient opts to refuse treatment). The aim is to explain in an ""intelligible"" way the merits of the proposal put forward, in order to obtain the patient's assent and, where appropriate, any reservations he or she may have, to enable him or her to seek any help he or she may need and to organize his or her life accordingly. This is information of a medical and social nature, prior to acceptance (or refusal) of the proposed treatment, with the aim of health education to improve compliance with prescriptions and optimize the effectiveness of the treatment.

In the case of diagnostic or therapeutic alternatives, on the other hand, information is part of a process of choice where, in theory, after being informed, the patient can opt for one proposal rather than another.

How far should we go in providing information? Should we talk about all the risks, including those of death linked to a treatment or those whose occurrence is exceptional?

The answers lie in the development of the legal rules governing the provision of information to a patient. Several criteria have been established to define the contractual framework between a doctor and his patient:

- The capacity of persons to contract with each other (qualified doctor, registered with the Conseil de l'ordre on the one hand; patient, of legal age, legally capable on the other).
- Quality criteria concerning the commitment of the professional (obligation to use reasonable means, respect for professional secrecy, etc.) and of the patient (compliance with prescriptions and monitoring rules).
- A lawful cause for the medical action: a clear and legitimate medical aim justifying the medical action that affects the patient's integrity.
- Consent must be obtained after the patient has been provided with quality information, without pressure, i.e., informed and free consent.

In this legal approach, information and consent become one of the criteria for the validity of a contract.

With regard to the characteristics of this information, on 21 December 1961, the Civil Division of the Court of Cassation emphasized that it should be ""simple, approximate, intelligible and fair."" Since 1995, article 35 of the Code of Medical Ethics has stipulated that:

""The doctor owes the person he is examining, treating or advising fair, clear and appropriate information about his condition, the investigations and care he is proposing. Throughout the course of the illness, he shall take account of the patient's personality in his explanations and ensure that they are understood.""

We note that the terms ""simple"" and ""approximate"" have disappeared, reflecting a desire to be more rigorous in the approach and rejecting excessive simplicity or approximation. As far as risks are concerned (bearing in mind that all medical procedures and prescriptions, even the most routine, involve them), the information must include them insofar as they are normally foreseeable.

With regard to the concepts of rarity and severity of the risk, in 2000 the Conseil d'√âtat (an administrative court that rules on disputes involving public hospitals) stated that the mere fact that risks occur only exceptionally does not relieve the practitioner of his obligation, and that when a medical act entails a risk of death or invalidity the patient must be informed, even if this is exceptional.

These developments led to the law of 4 March 2002, which stipulates that all frequent or serious risks that are normally foreseeable must be brought to the patient's attention before a procedure is carried out, but also ""a posteriori"" (i.e., in the short, medium and long term), if new consequences and risks are identified.

""Everyone has the right to be informed about their state of health. This information concerns the various investigations, treatments or preventive measures proposed, their usefulness, any urgency, their consequences, the frequent or serious risks normally foreseeable which they entail, as well as the other possible solutions and the foreseeable consequences in the event of refusal. When, after the investigations, treatments or preventive actions have been carried out, new risks are identified, the person concerned must be informed, unless it is impossible to trace him or her."" Law of 4 March 2002

== Rules and Criteria for Assessing the Quality of the Information Provided ==  
All healthcare professionals have a duty to provide information within the scope of their competence and in compliance with the professional rules applicable to them. The only exceptions to this duty are in cases of urgency or where it is impossible to provide information. This information is provided during an individual interview, as part of a dialogue. The purpose of the information is twofold:

- Respect patients' autonomy of choice by giving them all the information they need to make an informed decision, i.e., to consent to the proposed treatment.
- Provide them with all the information they need to take part in their care and receive all the advice and assistance they need to organize their lives.

This information is provided first and foremost to the patient. If the patient so wishes (i.e., with his or her consent, so as not to breach medical confidentiality without his or her knowledge), it can be given in the presence of a close relative or a trusted person. However, to ensure that the patient remains free to talk about matters that he or she would not wish to discuss in the presence of a third party, it is important to suggest that the interview should initially be an individual one, and that the third party should only be invited secondarily. In the case of minors and patients who are unable to reach the age of majority, information is provided to their parents or legal representatives, but without excluding the patient from access to information. As soon as their age and situation allow, patients must themselves receive information adapted to their degree of maturity. In the case of minors, as far as possible, the information is given to the two holders of parental authority. If only one is present, the healthcare professional will explain the need to inform the other, whether or not the couple are separated. In situations where the prognosis or risk is serious, it is preferable to have an interview with both parents.

On a day-to-day basis, the provision of information must comply with certain rules of good practice: it must be based on complete, validated data that is up to date with advances in medicine and science (in practice, this means that the data must be up to date); it must be understandable to everyone (avoiding medical-technical formulations that are the domain of professional terms and skills); and finally, in terms of content, it must meet five essential points, which must be addressed and discussed with every patient and their representative: the aims of the medical approach, its advantages and disadvantages, its risks, as well as the risks of not implementing it, the constraints generated and the impact on daily life, possible help and support: social rights, help (professional and/or associative) to facilitate the person's progress through the care pathway and their daily life.

== The Place of the Written Word and the Issue of Traceability of Information and Consent ==  
In practice, as far as the form is concerned, the information must remain above all oral. It may be aided by the provision of appropriate educational information documents to the patient. Apart from specific cases provided for by law (organ donation from a living person, biomedical research, genetic studies, medically assisted procreation, refusal of care, etc.), the information document is not a document intended to collect signed written consent. Its sole purpose is to provide patients with information that will enable them to come back to it once they have returned to their room or home and to ask any questions they may have.

The information document must meet the same quality criteria as those mentioned above. In addition, it is recommended that information documents should be drawn up by a collegiate body, within learned medical societies or healthcare groups and institutions, tested on patients and validated with user representatives. The advantage of consensual information of this kind is that it produces a benchmark drawn up by experts.

These documents should encourage patients to ask doctors any questions they may have. They can be enhanced with visual aids or linked to websites with animated diagrams or videos. They should be translated or explained in the patient's own language.

Another medico-legal issue concerns the traceability of the information provided, i.e., the elements that make it possible, in the event of a dispute, to prove that the patient has been properly informed. On 25 February 1997, a ruling by the French Supreme Court, known as the ""H√©dreul ruling"" - named after the patient concerned - quashed and annulled the judgment of a Court of Appeal concerning a colonoscopy with removal of a polyp, following which the patient had suffered an intestinal perforation, the risk of which he claimed he had not been informed. Initially, the Court of Appeal dismissed the case, ruling that the patient had to prove that the doctor had not warned him. In its ruling, the Court of Cassation reaffirmed that doctors have a specific obligation to inform their patients; it also stated that it is now up to the doctor to prove that he has fulfilled this obligation (creating what has been called a reversal of the burden of proof, which no longer lies with the patient). Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Court takes into account the reality of the consultation process, specifying that the methods of proof remain unrestricted and that, according to its ruling of 14 October 1997, information may be proven by any means, except in cases where a special legal provision imposes a particular method of proof (such as written consent, for example, in medical research, or for organ removal from living donors).

Since this decision, we have seen the development of brochures or information sheets on examinations and treatments. However, it should be remembered that these documents, although recommended, and even if some have patients sign them, do not free doctors and healthcare structures from other approaches. The quality of the information provided covers other aspects, which will also be taken into account in the event of a dispute. The following will be taken into account: consultation times, information meetings organized by healthcare structures, brochures given to patients, letters exchanged between doctors (in particular with the general practitioner) with copies given to patients, elements of the medical file given to patients.

It is important that all these information sessions are recorded in the medical record (by whom, in whose presence, on what date), together with any difficulties encountered in providing them. It is also important to mention any situations in which it was impossible or complex to obtain information, and to justify this on the basis of the patient's clinical and social situation.

It is therefore important not to forget that a written document does not free the doctor from all the other means of information that he or she may deem necessary, and in particular that the oral time spent with the patient is of major importance.",1.0,13.928333333333335,False,True,0.8042423129081726,0.7284829020500183,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Managing Living Donors

**Section: Management**

The shortage of organs has gradually led to an expansion in the circle of living donors, governed by Bioethics laws.

Living donor transplants are primarily used for kidney transplants (15.2% in 2018) and, to a lesser extent, for liver transplants (1% in 2018).

**Advantages of Living Donor Kidney Transplants:**

- Enables transplants requiring specific preparation, such as ABO-incompatible transplants or desensitization of the recipient with an anti-HLA antibody against a donor's HLA antigen.
- Offers better long-term survival of the transplanted organ.
- Helps combat the shortage of transplants.
- Reduces the recipient's waiting time.
- Allows for pre-emptive transplants, performed before the recipient starts extra-renal purification.

The medical assessment of potential donors ensures no underlying pathologies and seeks to minimize risks to the donor.

**Protection of Future Donors:**

- The living donor committee authorizes or refuses the donation and ensures the donor's decision is voluntary.
- The President of the Judicial Court checks that consent is free, informed, and compliant with legal conditions.

- **Normal Alleles:** Fewer than 45 CGG repeats, with 1 to 4 AGG interruptions.
- **Full Mutations:** More than 200 CGG repeats, found in males and females with neurodevelopmental disorders (and some asymptomatic females). These are associated with abnormal methylation of the promoter region, leading to repression of gene transcription.
- **Premutations:** 55 to 200 CGG repeats, without hypermethylation, found in healthy male carriers and the majority of female carriers.
- **Intermediate Alleles:** 45 to 54 CGG repeats, prone to instability and can progress to premutation within a few generations, depending on the number of AGG interruptions.

**Genetic Instability:**

- **Complete Mutations:** Favor breaks at the Xq27.3 end, observed in 5 to 40% of mitoses on the karyotype, which is the origin of the syndrome's name.
- **Premutations:** Unstable during transmission with a tendency to expand from a few trinucleotides to several dozen. The transition from a premutation to a full mutation occurs only during maternal transmission, with the risk of expansion to a full mutation in a single generation correlated with the size of the maternal premutation.

Ectopic Pregnancy (Item 25 - ectopic pregnancy)

**Symptomatic Ectopic Pregnancy (EP)**  
Presence of any one of these severity criteria indicates a surgical emergency: haemodynamic instability, abdominal defense, or haemoperitoneum on ultrasound.

**Surgical Treatment:**

- As a matter of urgency
- After conditioning of the patient, preoperative work-up, grouping, and RAI call from the anesthetist

In the absence of these three criteria, surgery is indicated in patients with algism and/or a Œ≤-hCG level greater than 5,000 IU/L.

Diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy confirms the diagnosis, specifies the location of the EP, and may identify risk factors (adhesions, sequelae of HGI). Conservative treatment options include salpingotomy or removal of the tube (salpingectomy).

**Pauci or Asymptomatic Ectopic Pregnancy (EP)**

In this case, treatment with methotrexate can be discussed with the patient: an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/m¬≤ in the absence of contraindications on the biological work-up (CBC, PT/ACT, renal and hepatic work-up).

Monitoring includes questioning about clinical symptoms and weekly monitoring of plasma Œ≤-hCG levels. A clinical examination and ultrasound scan may be carried out at any time in the event of functional signs suggesting a haemorrhagic complication of the EP. A second injection of methotrexate should be considered if the decrease in the plasma Œ≤-hCG level at day 7 is not satisfactory compared with the initial level (in practice, the Œ≤-hCG level at day 7 should be strictly lower than the level at day 0 or strictly lower than 85% of the Œ≤-hCG level at day 4 if this is available). Cure corresponds to an undetectable plasma Œ≤-hCG level, generally achieved after one month.

**Special Cases:**  
In certain exceptional cases, if the patient is asymptomatic, if the initial Œ≤-hCG level is less than 1,000 IU/L, and if the kinetics of Œ≤-hCG show a progressive and constant decrease, it may be possible to discuss abstention from treatment subject to good compliance by the patient (Œ≤-hCG measurement every 48 hours and clinical and ultrasound monitoring once a week).

== Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) ==

- Corrects the functional symptoms of climacteric symptoms such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, mood, and sleep disorders.
- Prevents the long-term tissue consequences of estrogen deficiency, including osteoporosis and the development of atherosclerosis.

MHT is based on the administration of estrogens, which must be combined with a progestogen in non-hysterectomized women due to the risk of endometrial cancer induced by estrogen treatments alone.

The human estrogen 17√ü-estradiol is the reference estrogen for hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which has made it possible to remove most of the metabolic contraindications (smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia) to the oestroprogestogenic pill.

Estrogens can be administered orally, but preferably parenterally (percutaneously, transdermally), which avoids digestive catabolism and the first-pass hepatic effect, thereby reducing the increased risk of venous thromboembolism and stroke associated with oral estrogens.

The progestogens recommended due to their better risk profile in terms of venous thrombo-embolic risk and especially breast cancer are natural progesterone and retroprogesterone or dydrogesterone.

== The different treatment regimens ==

Estrogens can be administered either discontinuously, 21 days or preferably 25 days a month, or continuously. To prevent endometrial hyperplasia, the progestogen sequence should not be less than 12 days per treatment cycle. Depending on whether the progestin is administered sequentially or continuously, treatment regimens are distinguished as ""with menstruation"" and ""without menstruation.""

**Rubric:** Definition

**Definitions**

Organ donation is governed by three major ethical principles enshrined in the French Bioethics Act:

- Presumed consent
- Free donation
- Anonymity between donor and recipient

The removal of organs from donors in a state of encephalic death is governed by the 1994 bioethics laws, which are based on the principle of presumed consent.

In addition, there is a National Register of Refusals (RNR) managed by the Agence de la Biom√©decine (French Biomedicine Agency), where people who are opposed to organ removal can register their refusal during their lifetime. This register will be automatically consulted before any removal procedure.

Since 1 January 2017, all deceased persons diagnosed as brain dead have been considered as donors by default. If a person is opposed to the removal of blood during their lifetime, they must register on the national refusal register or provide their next of kin with oral or written testimony. Relatives may testify to the refusal, but they must sign an official document certifying the deceased's refusal.

**Title:** Knowing the pathophysiology of hypersensitivity reactions: allergic and non-allergic  
**Description:** Added today  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**

Hypersensitivity: Objective, reproducible symptoms, initiated by exposure to a defined stimulus, at doses tolerated by healthy individuals.

A distinction is made between allergic hypersensitivities (proven immunological mechanism, specific to an allergen) and non-allergic hypersensitivities (pharmacological or via direct stimulation of innate immunity).

**Atopy**

Hereditary predisposition to produce IgE antibodies in response to low doses of allergens. Atopy is considered a risk factor for developing immediate hypersensitivity symptoms (asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic urticaria).

**Awareness**

A term classically used in atopy, defined by the presence of an immediate positive skin test to an allergen, without prejudging any clinical reaction of an allergic type. This means that the body has developed specific IgE antibodies to the allergen in question. It is possible to be sensitized without being allergic (no clinical symptoms). In this case, tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.) are more effective than IgE and protect against clinical allergy. The skin test will be positive, IgE will be present in the patient, but there will be no allergy symptoms.

**Allergy**

Hypersensitivity reaction caused by adaptive immunity mechanisms: mediated by antibodies (most often IgE) or cells (most often T lymphocytes). Allergy corresponds to an imbalance between sensitization and tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.).

**Allergens**

Antigens that induce the synthesis of antibodies (most often IgE) or specific T lymphocytes, inducing an allergic hypersensitivity reaction.

- Pneumallergens: Airborne allergens that are inhaled (nose, bronchi) or come into contact with the eyes.
- Trophallergens: Food allergens involved in food allergy reactions.
- Occupational allergens: Allergens present in the workplace.

**Physiopathology of Allergic Hypersensitivities**

All allergic hypersensitivities have two phases:

- A phase of central sensitization in the lymph nodes, asymptomatic, which leads to the synthesis of antibodies (IgE in HS type 1, IgM or IgG in HS type 2 or 3) or the differentiation of allergen-specific T lymphocytes (HS type 4).
- Peripheral revelation phase (in tissues), symptomatic (clinical allergy) following new contact with the allergen.

**Types of Hypersensitivity**

1. **Type 1 Hypersensitivity or Immediate Hypersensitivity**
   - This is the most common allergic reaction (allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic urticaria, anaphylactic shock, etc.).
   - It is mediated by IgE antibodies specific to one (or more) allergens.
   - After their synthesis (sensitization phase), IgE antibodies bind to receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophilic cells.
   - During the revelatory phase, the allergen binds to IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils, activating these cells and leading to:
     - The release of stored mediators (histamine, proteases).
     - The synthesis of other inflammatory mediators from arachidonic acid (prostaglandins, leukotrienes).
     - The production of chemokines, which attract and activate inflammatory cells, and cytokines, which perpetuate inflammation.
   - These different mediators induce bronchoconstriction, vasodilatation, extravasation, and edema, which are responsible for the clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis.
   - Activation of the inflammatory cascade leads to the recruitment of immune cells to the site of the allergic reaction, which explains why symptoms persist even though allergenic contact has ceased.

2. **Type 2 Hypersensitivity or Antibody-Related Cytotoxicity Reaction**
   - Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognize an ""allergen carried by a target cell"".
   - Activation of complement or immune cells (NK cells, phagocytes, etc.) then leads to destruction of the target cell.
   - Example: Drug-induced cytopenia.

3. **Type 3 Hypersensitivity or Immune Complex Reaction**
   - Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognize a ""circulating allergen"".
   - Formation of circulating soluble antigen/antibody complexes (or ""circulating immune complexes"").
   - These complexes are deposited in tissues and cause lesions due to inflammation by activating the complement system and recruiting inflammatory cells.
   - Example: Hypersensitivity pneumonia, serum sickness.

4. **Type 4 Hypersensitivity or Delayed Hypersensitivity**
   - Reaction mediated by allergen-specific memory T lymphocytes (LT), differentiated during the sensitization phase. The memory T cells recognize the allergen during the revelation phase (new contact with the allergen) and trigger either a cytotoxic reaction (TCD8+ lymphocytes) or a granulomatous reaction (TCD4+ lymphocytes) 48-72 hours after this new contact.
   - For example: CD8+ LT in contact eczema and certain drug allergies, LTCD4+ in hypersensitivity pneumonia, epithelioid and giganto-cellular granuloma (e.g., pulmonary granulomatosis).",0.9090909090909091,20.05826086956522,False,True,0.7397298812866211,0.8002090056737264,d,False,5,4

**Rubric:** Definition  

**Medically Assisted Procreation (MAP) Techniques Include:**

- **Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI):** Also known as artificial insemination (AI), this technique involves depositing selected spermatozoa in the uterus at the most opportune moment. It can be performed with sperm from a spouse (IAC) or from a donor (IAD). Insemination is ideally preceded by stimulation of follicular growth with gonadotropins (FSH or FSH+LH) to mature one to three follicles or induce ovulation for patients with menstrual cycle disorders (Abnormal genital bleeding (SD-112)). Pelvic ultrasound scans and hormone assays are necessary to monitor the ovarian response to stimulation, known as ovulation monitoring. Ovulation is triggered by an injection of recombinant hCG to synchronize ovulation (occurring 36 hours after triggering) and intrauterine sperm deposition. The day after induction, sperm is collected by masturbation in a specifically approved MAP laboratory under satisfactory aseptic conditions. Mobile spermatozoa are selected and inseminated into the uterine cavity using a suitable catheter.

- **In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF):** Conventional or assisted fertilisation with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is carried out in several stages.

  - **Ovarian Stimulation:** Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is achieved by administering high doses of exogenous gonadotropins (FSH alone or FSH + LH by subcutaneous injection). To prevent spontaneous premature ovulation, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is blocked by administering GnRH agonists or antagonists. Ovulation monitoring using pelvic ultrasound (follicular growth and endometrial thickness) and hormone monitoring (estradiol, LH, and progesterone levels) is required to:
    - Check the effectiveness of the stimulation (number of follicles growing).
    - Choose the optimum day for ovulation induction.
    - Identify situations where there is a risk of complications (e.g., ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome) or failure (e.g., insufficient ovarian response).

  - **Follicular Puncture:** Performed in the operating theatre (36 hours after ovulation is triggered), under local or general anesthetic, vaginally under ultrasound control. The follicular fluid is sent immediately to the laboratory for examination of cumulo-oocyte complexes.

  - **Sperm Preparation:** Typically involves a sperm sample taken by masturbation on the day of the follicular puncture. Frozen sperm from a spouse or third-party donor can also be used. Sperm taken surgically (from testicular tissue or epididymal liquid) in cases of azoospermia can be used fresh or after freezing. Sperm can also be recovered from alkalinized urine in cases of retrograde ejaculation. The recovered spermatozoa are prepared according to the ""in vitro"" fertilisation technique envisaged.

  - **Fertilisation:** Either conventional or classic (IVF-c) with the recovered oocytes brought into contact with prepared spermatozoa, or with intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection (ICSI).

  - **Culture and Embryo Transfer:** After fertilisation, the embryos obtained are cultured. One or two embryos can be transferred to the uterus after 2 to 6 days of culture. The choice of the number of embryos and the day of transfer depends on various factors. A pregnancy blood test is carried out approximately 14 days after the puncture.

  - **Embryo Freezing:** Non-transferred embryos with adequate development can be frozen using cryoprotectants and stored in liquid nitrogen (-196¬∞C) in reproductive biology laboratories. When frozen embryos are used, they are thawed and transferred to the uterus, which has been prepared using various protocols.

**Types of MPA:**

- **Intra-Marital:** Using the gametes, oocytes, and spermatozoa of both members of the couple.
- **Third Party Donor:** Involves a sperm donor, oocyte donor, or a couple who have agreed to donate embryos frozen during a previous IVF procedure for which they no longer have parental plans.

Double gamete donation (oocytes and sperm) is possible under the French Bioethics Act 2021. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) can be performed in the context of ""viral risk"" (HIV, hepatitis B, and/or C) in approved centers.

The various aetiologies are suggested based on the history and examination. The general examination is supplemented by a neurological examination to look for motor deficits, pyramidal, parkinsonian or cerebellar syndromes, deep sensitivity disorders, and cognitive disorders.

**The Different Origins of Gait Disorders:**

- **Walking Disorders of Painful Origin:** The disorder is due to a pain avoidance mechanism (avoidance lameness) or a real limitation (intermittent claudication). Some pains are very specific, such as exertional myalgia and the second wind phenomenon of McArdle's disease (muscular glycogenosis).

- **Walking Disorders of Ataxic Origin:**  
  - Cerebellar ataxia: static, kinetic, and locomotor cerebellar syndrome.  
  - Vestibular ataxia: vertigo, gait deviation, maneuvers.  
  - Proprioceptive ataxia: heeling gait, hypopallesthesia.

- **Gait Disorders of Central Origin:** Central motor deficit disorder, often due to cerebrovascular accident sequelae, typically presents as hemiparesis or hemiplegia resulting in mowing, with the homolateral upper limb fixed in adduction.

- **Peripheral Gait Disorders:** Motor disorders of peripheral origin often affect the extremities (steppage) or involve muscular disorders with a symmetrical and predominantly proximal deficiency, resulting in a waddling gait.

- **Gait Disorder with Small Steps:** Parkinsonian syndrome (small-step walking, paroxysmal festination freezing), lacunar walking, or chronic hydrocephalus in adults.

**Other Walking Disorders:**

- **Dystonia:** A hyperkinetic motor disorder characterized by pseudo-stepping, painful varus equinus foot, ""heron"" gait with elevation of the knees, pseudo-spastic gait, and ""dromedary gait"" with alternative flexion-extension of the trunk. A dopa-sensitivity test should be performed.

**Title:** Principles of Symptomatic Treatment of Edematous Syndromes  
**Description:** Guidelines for the use of different classes of diuretics  

# VI. Symptomatic Treatment of Generalized Edema and Monitoring

## A. Treatment

- Treatment of the underlying cause
- Symptomatic treatment to induce a negative sodium balance

1. Restriction of sodium intake  
   - Salt-restricted diet providing 2 to 4 g NaCl (i.e., 35 to 70 mmoles of sodium)  
   - In the absence of hyponatremia (intracellular hyperhydration), there should be no restriction of water intake.

2. Increased elimination of sodium  
   - Henle loop diuretics have the most powerful natriuretic effect  
     - Furosemide and bumetanide are used in higher doses when renal function is impaired.  
     - The injectable form, particularly continuous infusion, allows greater natriuresis to be achieved when edema is major or resistant to oral treatment.  
     - The doses of furosemide used range from 20 to 500 mg per day orally or intravenously. The venous route allows the dosage of the diuretic to be titrated progressively and requires dosages 2 times lower.

- Distal-acting diuretics have a synergistic effect with loop diuretics:  
  - Spironolactone helps to avoid the hypokalemia induced by loop diuretics by having a synergistic effect on natriuresis. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment.  
  - Amiloride also has a synergistic effect with loop diuretics. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment.

- Thiazides have a synergistic effect on natriuresis. The combination of loop diuretic and hydrochlorothiazide is very effective, particularly in patients with cardiac insufficiency.

- Infusion of albumin or other products responsible for volemic expansion have very limited indications (ascites puncture in cirrhosis).

## B. Monitoring

1. Clinical  
   - Tolerance monitoring involves:  
     - Pulse, standing and lying blood pressure to look for orthostatic arterial hypotension.  
     - Weight loss should be limited to less than 1 kg/day in subjects at risk of developing functional renal failure, particularly the elderly, diabetic or nephrotic patients, and patients with chronic renal failure.

2. Biology  
   - 24-hour natriuresis increases in the first few days following the introduction or increase in dose of diuretics.  
   - The appearance of side effects will be monitored:  
     - Functional acute renal failure: measurement of blood urea and creatinine.  
     - Hemoconcentration: protidemia, hematocrit.  
     - Ionic disorders: kalaemia (+++), natremia.

Premature ovarian failure (POI) is defined by:

- Primary or secondary amenorrhea lasting more than 4 months
- Before the age of 40
- Associated with an increase in pituitary gonadotropins

Diagnostic confirmation is based on an increase in FSH > 25 IU/l combined with estradiol < 20 pg/ml on two occasions 4 weeks apart.

Its prevalence is around 1 to 2%. Familial forms account for 10-15% of cases, but in 80% of cases, no etiology is found.

- Regular visits to the toilet and an improved defecation position (legs raised, use of a step stool) are important.
- Physical exercise does not improve constipation.
- Anorectal rehabilitation can be useful for distal constipation.
- Psychological treatment may be necessary depending on the context.
- Surgery is rare and mainly concerns pelvic static disorders (e.g., rectocele).
- Treatments such as endoscopic caecostomy or surgery are the domain of expert centres.

**Laxatives**

- There are different categories of laxatives.
- First-line laxatives include osmotic and ballast laxatives.
- Irritant, lubricant, and prokinetic laxatives may be used as second-line treatments. Irritant laxatives should be used with caution due to the risk of colonic melanosis (laxative disease).

== In Children ==

- **General Recommendations:**
  - Learning to exonerate: teaching and parental reassurance.
  - Defecatory hygiene: try daily without forcing or coercing, ideally after a meal.
  - Improving practical conditions: adapted toilet seat, blocks under the feet for effective pushing, intervention with the school.
  - Lifestyle: regular mealtimes and sufficient physical activity (e.g., swimming).
  - Stopping constipating drugs, if possible.

Ambulatory surgery is defined as all surgical or medical, diagnostic or therapeutic procedures carried out under the technical safety conditions of an operating theatre, under variable anaesthesia and with no increased risk for the patient. This enables patients to be discharged on the same day as their admission, without overnight accommodation. To ensure the safety of this care, the selection criteria used to validate outpatient care must be assessed prior to surgery (""Information and monitoring of a patient undergoing outpatient surgery (SD-356)"").

Ambulatory surgery is part of the broader concept of early rehabilitation after surgery (RAC), which is a comprehensive approach to patient care that promotes early recovery of the patient's abilities after surgery. The key points of an Early Patient Recovery (EPR) are:

- Informing patients and training them in the process

**Title:** Knowing How to Distinguish Between Typical and Atypical Hot Flushes

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

Hot flushes (SD-024) are characterized by the sudden onset of a sensation of heat accompanied by sweating, which interferes with sleep and can even lead to a disabling vasomotor flush.

The expression, duration, date of onset, and intensity of hot flushes vary greatly from one woman to another. The maximum frequency of hot flushes occurs one to two years after menopause.

The duration of symptoms varies greatly from one woman to another, averaging around 7 years, but they can sometimes be observed up to 20 years after the onset of menopause.

Questioning and clinical examination are essential to distinguish typical BVM from atypical BVM, which should be investigated for other causes.

**Typical Motor Flushes**

- Occur during the peri-menopause or menopause
- Mainly nocturnal but can also be diurnal
- Most often occur without premonitory signs
- Favored by emotions and high temperatures

**Atypical Hot Flushes**

Atypical hot flushes or motor flushes will be considered in practice:

- When BVMs do not subside with the use of a suitable menopausal hormone treatment (compliance and correct use)
- When they appear or reappear at a distance from menopause
- When there are modifications to the usual BVMs
- When they are associated with other functional signs such as headaches, palpitations, malaise, diarrhea, or hypertensive crises

**Assessment of Flushing**

- Questioning: symptoms, frequency, time of day, duration, intensity, triggering factors (exertion, stress, meals, food or medication), associated signs
- A clinical examination will rule out fever, high blood pressure, palpitations, and poor general condition; an examination of the lungs, abdomen, thyroid gland, neurology, skin, and lymph nodes is necessary

## Examination of the Hips (Term Newborn Examination SD-039)

Congenital dislocation of the hips (CDH) affects 3 to 20 children per 1000 births, with 4 girls for every 1 boy. CDH results from an abnormality in the antenatal development of the hip, leading to instability of the joint or even dislocation at birth. The risk factors for CDH are:  
- Family history of 1st degree CDH  
- Breech presentation, regardless of the mode of delivery  
- Limitation of unilateral or bilateral hip abduction  
- Congenital asymmetric pelvis  
- Associated postural abnormalities (genu recurvatum, torticollis)  

Screening consists of a clinical examination at birth and at each consultation until walking age, looking for:  
- Asymmetry of the folds and lengths of the lower limbs  
- Abduction limitation <60¬∞  
- Instability of the hip using the Barlow manoeuvre, which reveals a protrusion in the case of a ""dislocatable hip"" or ""reducible dislocated hip."" In the case of an irreducible dislocated hip, there is no protrusion, only a limitation of abduction with asymmetry  

If there are any abnormalities in the clinical examination or risk factors for CDH, an ultrasound scan of the hips is prescribed. After 4 months, the reference examination is a pelvic X-ray.

## Hearing Screening (Hearing Loss/Deafness)

5% of children under the age of 6 have a hearing defect. Congenital CMV infection is the leading cause of congenital deafness. Risk factors for congenital deafness are:  
- Family history  
- Birth before 32 weeks' gestation and/or birth weight <1800g  
- Perinatal asphyxia  
- Hyperbilirubinaemia >350 ¬µmol/L  
- Neurological disorders  
- Malformation of the face and neck  
- Foetopathy (CMV, rubella, herpes, toxoplasmosis)  
- Ototoxic treatment  

Screening is carried out systematically in maternity wards using induced acoustic emission tests (EAPT). If the examination is abnormal on two occasions, the newborn is referred to an ENT specialist for a check-up. If abnormalities are confirmed on examination, an audiogram and auditory evoked potentials will be carried out in a specialist centre.

## Visual Screening

The risk factors for visual problems are:  
- Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation  
- Neurological disorders  
- Deafness  
- Chromosomal anomalies (trisomy 21, etc.)  
- Craniostenosis, craniofacial dysostoses  
- Embryo-fetopathies (toxoplasmosis)  
- In utero exposure to cocaine, alcohol  
- Family history of hereditary ophthalmological disease (congenital cataract, congenital glaucoma, etc.)  

Screening is based on clinical examination:  
- Eyelids: ptosis, epicanthus, angioma  
- Eyeballs: microphthalmia, buphthalmia  
- Conjunctivae: redness, tearing  
- Corneas: symmetry of corneal reflections, corneal opacity  
- Pupils: leukocoria (retinoblastoma, cataract), anisocoria (neuroblastoma)  
- Iris  

The examination assesses ocular pursuit with a target and looks for the presence of nystagmus. Intermittent and alternating strabismus may indicate delayed acquisition of oculomotricity up to the age of 3 months. Permanent or divergent strabismus, whatever the age, or present after the age of 3 months, should be considered pathological (Child Strabismus SD-157).",0.75,12.314736842105265,False,True,0.8653316497802734,0.6190031965573629,b,False,5,3

**Title:** Defining the Concept of No-Fault Liability and the Role of the National Office for Compensation for Medical Accidents (ONIAM)

**Description:** Knowing how to refer a case to ONIAM

**Rubric:** Definition

== Reasons for Referral ==

ONIAM and the CCI are separate institutions, but they work towards the same goal within the same procedure: to compensate victims of medical accidents as fairly as possible.

- **ONIAM:** Office National d'Indemnisation des Accidents M√©dicaux, des Affections Iatrog√®nes et des Infections Nosocomiales (National Office for Compensation for Medical Accidents, Iatrogenic Diseases and Nosocomial Infections).
- **CCI:** Commission de Conciliation et d'Indemnisation des accidents m√©dicaux (Conciliation and Compensation Commission for Medical Accidents)

The ICCs, which meet between one and four times a month, are chaired by a magistrate and are made up of members representing:

- Users
- Healthcare professionals
- Health establishments
- Insurers
- ONIAM
- Qualified personalities

A case may be referred to the CCI if a patient (or their beneficiaries in the event of death) is the victim of a ""medical accident,"" an ""iatrogenic condition,"" or a ""nosocomial infection"" resulting in ""serious harm.""

A medical accident is considered ""serious"" if it causes damage in excess of the following thresholds:

- A rate of permanent physical or mental injury (AIPP) of more than 24%
- Temporary cessation of professional activities (ATAP) for a period of at least six consecutive months or six non-consecutive months in any twelve-month period
- Temporary discomfort constituting a functional deficit (DFT) equal to or greater than 50% for a period of at least six consecutive months or six non-consecutive months over a period of twelve months

Or exceptionally:

- When the victim is declared definitively unfit to carry out the professional activity they were performing before the medical accident
- When the medical accident, iatrogenic condition, or nosocomial infection causes ""particularly serious problems,"" including economic problems, in the victim's living conditions

== Referral Procedure ==

**Step 1: Preparation of the File by the Victim**

Within 10 years of consolidation of the state of health and as part of a free procedure, the victim sends the CCI a claim form accompanied by various supporting documents.

*Consolidation is the date at which it can be considered that the victim's state of health is no longer likely to change, worsen, or improve. In the absence of consolidation of the victim's state of health before their death, the starting point for the limitation period is the date of the victim's death.

**Step 2: Assessment of the Application by the ICC**

From the date of receipt of a complete file, the ICC has 6 months to give its opinion on the circumstances, causes, nature, and extent of the damage suffered by the victim and on the applicable compensation scheme.

The ICC's assessment of cases is based on expert opinions. These expert reports are requested by the Chairman of the CCI from medical experts in the discipline involved in the case under review, who are on the list of experts.

**Step 3: Compensation Offer**

The Office National d'Indemnisation des Accidents M√©dicaux, des Affections Iatrog√®nes et des Infections Nosocomiales (ONIAM) or the insurer of the healthcare provider in question (depending on whether it concerns a therapeutic hazard or a fault) has a period of 4 months from receipt of the notice to make an offer of compensation to the victim and a period of 1 month to pay if the victim accepts the offer.

**Optional Step**

If the insurer refuses or remains silent after the 4-month period, the victim may ask ONIAM to take the place of the insurer. ONIAM then has a period of 4 months from receipt of a valid request to inform the victim of its position and make a proposal for compensation. ONIAM can then take action against the insurer.",0.75,16.59,False,True,0.7592650055885315,0.9186168511708578,b,False,2,4

**Immunosuppression is intended to:**

- Prevent acute rejection in the initial phase (induction treatment).
- Prevent rejection after the initial phase (maintenance treatment).
- Treat acute rejection (curative treatment).

**Induction Treatment:**

- It allows strong immunosuppression to be introduced during the first few days of transplantation, when the risk of rejection is highest.
- The molecules used are polyclonal antibodies that deplete T lymphocytes or a non-depleting monoclonal antibody.

**Maintenance Treatment:**

- The aim is to prevent the occurrence of an acute rejection episode in the long term, with the least possible iatrogenicity.
- Maintenance treatment usually involves a combination of 2 or 3 immunosuppressive agents from different families.

Immunosuppressive treatment increases the risk of infectious and tumor complications, warranting specialized follow-up of immunosuppressed patients (SD-291).

- Close monitoring and gradual discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment with objectives: PAS < 150 mmHg and PAD < 100 mmHg.
  
- If breast-feeding, give preference to:
  - Beta-blockers (labetalol, propranolol)
  - Calcium channel blockers (nicardipine, nifedipine)
  - Alphamethyldopa
  - Converting enzyme inhibitors (benazepril, captopril, enalapril, quinapril) if the patient is not breast-feeding.

The Bi-Rad Classification is used to assess breast lesions. Lesions classified as Bi-rads 4 and 5 (imaging classification) must be biopsied, as must lesions classified as Bi-rads 3 in BRCA mutated patients or patients who are otherwise carriers of a malignant biopsied lesion.

These biopsies are carried out preoperatively, reducing the need for peroperative extemporaneous examination and making it possible to define a course of action with the patient before the operation.

Breast biopsies are performed in two ways: microbiopsies or macrobiopsies. Microbiopsies are usually performed under ultrasound guidance (ultrasound mass), and macrobiopsies are usually performed under stereotaxis (mammographic microcalcification focus). Macrobiopsies may also be performed under MRI when the lesion classified as Bi-rads 4 or 5 is not visible on mammography or ultrasound. The biopsy is used to confirm the histological diagnosis and assess a number of prognostic factors.

Cytology samples are not recommended for a mass or a focus of microcalcifications. However, cytology of a suspicious axillary adenopathy or of a nipple discharge in the case of a suspicious discharge (bloody) may be useful.

Finally, in the event of radio-clinical discordance or if it is impossible to reach the lesion (focus of deep microcalcifications in a small breast), a surgical biopsy may exceptionally be indicated.",0.6666666666666666,8.756666666666668,False,True,0.7654764652252197,0.793651262919108,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Knowing the Objectives and Principles of Breast Cancer Treatment  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Management  

== Objectives ==  
In localized stages, treatment is curative and always includes breast surgery and surgery of the homolateral axillary lymph nodes. Depending on various prognostic/predictive factors and the type of surgery, chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy and/or treatment with trastuzumab (anti-HER2 antibody) and/or radiotherapy may be carried out in the (neo)adjuvant setting.

In metastatic stages, treatment cannot be curative and is essentially based on systemic treatments (chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapies). The aim of these treatments is to increase patients' survival and improve their quality of life.

== Treatment Principles ==  
Don't forget the associated measures:

- Discussion of the therapeutic strategy at a multidisciplinary consultation meeting (RCP) to define the optimal treatment for the patient.
- Announcement consultation, explanation of the personalized care plan (PPS).
- Application for exemption from co-payment (ALD 30).
- Comprehensive care, including psychological, social, and dietary support.
- Supportive care deals with the consequences of the disease and its treatment, and can include pain management, nutrition, fatigue, fertility/sexuality, adapted physical activity sessions, art therapy, socio-aesthetic advice, etc.

=== 1. Surgery ===  
Breast treatment may be conservative or radical, depending on the size of the tumor, the number of sites, the volume of the breast, and any associated lesions (carcinoma in situ).

Surgery of the armpit is always associated with invasive carcinoma. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to drain the mammary gland: its anatomopathological analysis, when negative, makes it possible to dispense with the more morbid lymph node dissection; it involves double identification by injection of technetium and patent blue or by fluorescence using indocyanine green. If the lymph node is invaded preoperatively (positive puncture under ultrasound), axillary lymph node dissection is carried out immediately.

=== 2. Radiotherapy ===  
Breast radiotherapy combines external radiotherapy of the whole breast and additional radiation in the operating bed (""boost""). It is used systematically after conservative surgery.

Parietal radiotherapy (after mastectomy) combined with an additional dose in the operating bed is indicated in the presence of several poor prognostic factors.

Radiotherapy of the lymph nodes is justified in the case of axillary lymph node involvement (supra-clavicular fossa +/- internal mammary chain).

=== 3. Systemic Treatments ===  
In the localized stages of the disease, systemic treatments are either ""adjuvant"" (after surgery) or ""neoadjuvant"" (before surgery). The aim of (neo)adjuvant treatment is to destroy distant micro-metastases that are not detected by the extension work-up, thereby reducing the risk of relapse, particularly in the form of metastases.

In the metastatic stage, treatments are given throughout the course of the disease (except in the final palliative phase) and are adapted to the course of the disease and the patient's tolerance.

- **Chemotherapy:** The two main families used are anthracyclines and taxanes. Adverse reactions are detailed in item 294.
- **Hormone Therapy:** Either anti-oestrogen (tamoxifen) or anti-aromatase (letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane). The main hormonal effects are hot flushes, weight gain, arthralgia, thrombosis, and increased risk of endometrial cancer (tamoxifen) and osteoporosis (anti-aromatase).
- **Targeted Therapies:** A large number of targeted therapies are used in oncology. The main class that has made it possible to change the natural history of breast cancer by increasing the cure rate of certain cancers is the anti-HER2 class. The leader is trastuzumab.

=== 4. Monitoring ===  
It includes:

- Joint management by: surgeon, medical oncologist, radiotherapist, general practitioner, gynecologist, etc.
- A clinical breast examination at least twice a year for the first 5 years, then annually.
- A mammogram and ultrasound are carried out every year for life.
- Other examinations are carried out on request.

=== 5. Support Care ===  
This is systematic and helps to maintain quality of life. In the case of bone metastases, it is essential to prescribe a bisphosphonate or denosumab to limit bone complications. Deconditioning during exercise is often identified and may be the subject of a medical prescription for adapted physical activity.",1.0,12.935789473684213,False,True,0.7593145966529846,0.5449487169583639,c,False,4,4

== Elements of seriousness in the case of acute urinary retention ==  
The elements of seriousness in the case of acute retention of urine are:

- Fever: In the event of fever associated with acute retention of urine, prostatitis should be investigated (BU/ECBU). Hospitalization and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.

- Hematuria (2C-260): In the event of hematuria associated with acute retention of urine, bladder catheterization with bladder washes (dual stream catheter) will be required.

- Acute renal failure (2C-258): Endovesical hyperpressure due to acute retention of urine can lead to dilatation of the pyelocaval cavities, which can induce acute renal failure. Late-onset clinical signs include nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, diarrhea, and headache.

== Complications secondary to acute urinary retention ==  
Complications secondary to acute retention of urine are:

- Vacuo hematuria: This is caused by the rupture of submucosal veins when the bladder is emptied too quickly. It is advisable to empty the bladder gradually and to clamp the bladder catheter every 500 ml.

- Obstruction lifting syndrome: Transient polyuria with risk of dehydration due to water overload and tubulopathy with inability to concentrate urine. Screening is based on hourly monitoring of diuresis. Treatment is based on intravenous water compensation.

**Description:** Understand how prostate cancer spreads locally, the main lymphatic routes, and sites of metastatic dissemination.  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Prostate Cancer Spread**

In most cases, prostate cancer is localized (limited to the prostate). When the tumor grows locally, it may cross the capsule and reach the seminal vesicles and adjacent organs (rectum, bladder neck, external sphincter, pelvic wall).

- Lymphatic extension is to the pelvic regional lymph nodes (iliac) and then to distant non-regional lymph nodes (lumbo-aortic).
- The main site of non-node metastasis is bone, but the tumor can also spread to the lung and liver.

**Extension Assessment**

Extension assessment of localized/locally advanced prostate cancer depends on the d'Amico prognostic group (CC-AFU 2022-2024) (OIC-310-07-B):

- Low risk: pelvic MRI
- Intermediate risk: pelvic MRI + bone scan with SPECT/CT (if ISUP: 3, 4, or 5)
- High risk: pelvic MRI + bone scan with SPECT/CT + thoraco-abdominopelvic CT scan

For all three groups, prostate MRI is requested for local extension (capsule, seminal vesicles) if it has not been performed prior to biopsies.

Extension work-up for metastatic prostate cancer includes a bone scan and thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan. In metastatic prostate cancer, pelvic MRI is optional.

**TNM Classification (2018)**

**Primary Tumor (T)**

- T0: Primary tumor not found
- T1: Tumor not palpable on digital rectal examination (DRE) or visible on imaging

  - T1b: Tumor occupying more than 5% of resected tissue or ISUP score ‚â• 2 or presence of grade 4 or 5.
  - T1c: Tumor discovered on prostate biopsy due to an elevated PSA value.
- T2: Tumor confined to the prostate
  - T2a: Tumor affecting half a lobe or less
  - T2b: Tumor affecting more than half a lobe but not both lobes.
  - T2c: Tumor affecting both lobes
- T3: Extension beyond the prostate gland
  - T3a: Uni- or bilateral extra-prostatic extension
  - T3b: Extension to the seminal vesicles uni- or bilaterally
- T4: Tumor fixed or involving structures other than the seminal vesicles (external sphincter, rectum, anus lift muscle, or pelvic wall).

The choice of study methodology depends on the objective being pursued. To assess the suitability of these methods, it is crucial to define this objective precisely:

- **Specify the Question Asked:**
  - The outcome criterion(s).
  - The exposure factor(s) studied, if any.
    - Risk factors in analytical studies (see ""Risk factor, etiological factor, prognostic factor, health determinants, exposure factor 2C-020-DE-A04"").

  - The target population (see ""Target population and source, sample 2C-020-DE-A05"").

- **Specify the Approach:**
  - Observational: The nature and level of the exposure factors to which the subjects included in the study are subjected are not modified.
  - Experimental: Subjects are subjected to an experimental intervention which would not have taken place, or not under the same conditions, or not at the same time, if they had not been included in the study.

- **Specify the Aim of the Study:**
  - Descriptive Studies: Always observational, their aim is to describe the distribution or changes in the frequency of health events and their determinants in the population.
  - Explanatory Studies (Analytical Studies): Always observational, their aim is to identify the existence of an association between a risk factor and a health phenomenon.
  - Experimental Studies: The approach is experimental by definition. The exposure factor studied is an experimental intervention carried out for the study (controlled by the experimenter) whose effect on a health phenomenon is to be evaluated.

Constipation in children is most often functional, requiring symptomatic treatment through hygienic and dietary measures, often combined with medication.

An organic cause should be considered in the presence of certain warning signs or in the event of a poor response to well-managed first-line treatment.

The functional origin is multi-factorial and develops after 6 months. Before 6 months, the mechanism is essentially reflex.

Repeated retention of stool in the rectal ampulla leads to constipation. This is known as terminal retention.

Other mechanisms may contribute to functional constipation:

- Lack of water or fiber intake
- Exclusive lacto-meal diet

The organic origin is explained by different mechanisms, depending on the cause:

- Absence of colonic contraction
- Ionic disorders
- Medicines
- Insufficient thrust

**Title:** Antiepileptic Drugs: Mechanisms of Action, Indications, Side Effects, Drug Interactions, Monitoring Procedures, and Main Causes of Failure

**Description:** Knowing the mechanisms of action

**Rubric:** Management

== Drug Classes ==
Anti-epileptic drugs are traditionally classified into ""two or even three generations,"" distinguishing between those marketed until the 1970s and those available from the 1990s onwards:

- **First-generation anti-epileptics:** phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, ethosuximide, carbamazepine, valproic acid, and benzodiazepines.
- **Second and third-generation anti-epileptics:** vigabatrin, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, felbamate, gabapentin, tiagabine, topiramate, levetiracetam, pregabalin, stiripentol, zonisamide, rufinamide, lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, perampanel, brivaracetam.

Many second and third-generation drugs were initially developed for combination use to address ""drug-resistant epilepsy."" Monotherapy use could be granted later.

== Mechanisms of Action ==
Anti-epileptic drugs primarily act by limiting hyperexcitability, which triggers seizures. This is achieved by affecting ion channels involved in hyperexcitability or restoring the GABA/Glutamate balance.

Common mechanisms include:

- **Blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels:** This is a primary mechanism for many drugs (e.g., valproic acid, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, felbamate, topiramate, zonisamide, rufinamide, lacosamide, eslicarbazepine).
- **Blockade of calcium or potassium channels:** More incidental, involving drugs like gabapentin, pregabalin, and levetiracetam.
- **Reduction of glutamatergic tone:** Through inhibition of vesiculosynaptic protein 2A (levetiracetam, brivaracetam) or glutamate receptor antagonism (felbamate, topiramate, perampanel, phenobarbital).
- **Reinforcement of GABAergic tone:** Directly (valproic acid, gabapentin) or via GABA-A receptor agonists (phenobarbital, benzodiazepines, topiramate, felbamate), GABA transaminase inhibitors (vigabatrin, stiripentol), or GABA reuptake inhibitors (tiagabine, stiripentol).

Most drugs exert effects by modulating multiple targets.

== Indications ==
Treatment choice considers the compound's activity profile, epilepsy type, and patient contraindications. Valproic acid is effective in generalized epilepsy, while carbamazepine is active in partial epilepsy. Specialized management is required for some prescriptions, especially in drug-resistant partial epilepsies or specific syndromes.

**Broad-spectrum antiepileptics:** Effective for generalized and partial epilepsies include valproic acid, benzodiazepines, perampanel, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, rufinamide, felbamate.

**Narrow-spectrum antiepileptics:** Effective for partial epilepsy with or without generalization include carbamazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin, pregabalin, lacosamide, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, tiagabine, vigabatrin.

Benzodiazepines, especially clonazepam, are used occasionally, particularly in status epilepticus. Second-line treatments include injectable fosphenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, or levetiracetam.

Some drugs also treat neuropathic pain (pregabalin, gabapentin, carbamazepine), migraines (topiramate), and mood disorders in bipolar illness (valproic acid, carbamazepine, lamotrigine).

== Undesirable Effects and Contraindications ==
All antiepileptic drugs have dose-dependent effects on the central nervous system (sedation, dizziness, visual disturbances, tremors) and can induce cognitive and psychiatric effects (depression, anxiety, psychotic reactions), particularly with levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, vigabatrin, and perampanel. Severe idiosyncratic reactions (skin, hepatitis, bone marrow damage) can occur.

Weight gain is reported with valproic acid, carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, perampanel, while others (topiramate, zonisamide, felbamate, stiripentol, rufinamide) cause weight loss.

Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproic acid are teratogenic, requiring precautions in women of childbearing age.

**Other Side Effects to Consider:**

- **Valproic acid:** Nausea, vomiting, alopecia; serious: thrombocytopenia, aplasia, hepatitis, pancreatitis.
- **Carbamazepine:** Leukoneutropenia, rash; serious: hyperponatremia, BAV, Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis, agranulocytosis.
- **Eslicarbazepine:** Leukoneutropenia; serious: hyponatremia, rash, Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis, agranulocytosis, AVB.
- **Ethosuximide:** Nausea; serious: bullous rash, agranulocytosis.
- **Felbamate:** Leukoneutropenia, rash; serious: bone marrow aplasia, hepatitis, Lyell's disease.
- **Lacosamide:** Nausea, vomiting; serious: stroke, atrial fibrillation, flutter.
- **Lamotrigine:** Leukoneutropenia; serious: rash, Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis.
- **Levetiracetam:** Nausea; serious: hematologic disorders.
- **Oxcarbazepine:** Nausea, leukoneutropenia; serious: hyperponatremia, rash, Stevens-Johnson, BAV.
- **Phenobarbital:** Rash; serious: Dupuytren's disease, scapulohumeral periarthritis, hepatitis, megaloblastic anemia.
- **Phenytoin:** Rash, gingival hypertrophy; serious: Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis, pseudo-lymphoma, lupus syndrome.
- **Rufinamide:** Nausea, vomiting; serious: QT depression, hypersensitivity.
- **Topiramate:** Anorexia, oligohydrosis; serious: renal lithiasis, acidosis, glaucoma.
- **Vigabatrin:** Digestive disorders; serious: visual field narrowing.
- **Zonisamide:** Anorexia, oligohydrosis; serious: Stevens-Johnson, renal lithiasis, bone marrow aplasia, hyperthermia.

== Drug Interactions ==
Anti-epileptic drugs present challenges in drug-drug interactions, as some modify the metabolism of other drugs. Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and phenytoin are enzyme inducers, while valproic acid is an enzyme inhibitor.

Interactions between anti-epileptic drugs can lead to ineffectiveness or toxicity by altering plasma concentrations. Certain combinations, like valproic acid/lamotrigine, are inadvisable due to skin toxicity. Phenytoin and stiripentol are metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, respectively, enzymes subject to genetic polymorphism, posing interaction risks.

== Monitoring Methods ==
Monitoring of epileptic patients on treatment must consider several dimensions.

**Clinical Monitoring:**

- Assess overall progress, efficacy, and adverse effects at each consultation and at least once a year.
- Monitor nutritional status and measurements, especially in children.
- Check for presence/persistence of attacks.
- Ensure compliance with treatment and carer adherence.
- Address common co-morbidities: anxiety, depression, suicidal risk, attention, neurodevelopmental, and cognitive disorders.
- Evaluate undesirable effects potentially linked to treatment.
- Consider social repercussions.
- Regularly re-evaluate treatments to avoid inappropriate use.
- Use tools like a crisis monitoring calendar to facilitate management.

**Biological Monitoring:**

- Blood tests for drugs are not recommended systematically and should be done if clinically indicated.
- Minor asymptomatic biological abnormalities require monitoring but not necessarily a change in treatment.
- Adapt monitoring of adverse biological reactions according to the drug used and patient condition.

**Electrophysiological Monitoring:**

- EEG can be useful for follow-up and monitoring under treatment.
- Frequency depends on the patient's epileptic syndrome.

== Main Causes of Failure ==
Reasons for treatment failure include:

- Inappropriate drug prescription due to diagnostic error.
- Compliance failure, which can be reduced by therapeutic education of the patient and caregivers.
- Occurrence of undesirable effects, mitigated by progressive titration and patient education.
- Drug resistance affects 20% of patients and requires expert center treatment.",0.8,12.172307692307694,False,True,0.668763279914856,0.6175949573516846,d,False,2,4

# Medication Errors - Reporting

## Why Declare?

To implement measures that will limit the risk of the error recurring. The measures implemented depend on the nature of the error.

All undesirable events deserve to be analyzed to understand why they occurred and how to prevent them from happening again. In addition, serious events are reported so that experiences can be shared at regional and national levels.

## How to Register

### Via the Portal for Reporting Adverse Health Events

- If the error involves an adverse reaction: select the ""pharmacovigilance"" section.
- If the error has no adverse effect: select ""Medication error with no effect"".
- If the error is the cause of a serious adverse event related to care, select: ""Serious adverse events associated with care (SAEs) - declaration - 1st part"". The declaration will then be sent to the Regional Health Agency (ARS). Once the root causes have been analyzed, part 2 should be sent to the portal. Also select ""pharmacovigilance"" if the SAE concerns a potential drug-related effect.

A serious adverse event related to healthcare (EIGS) is an unexpected event with regard to the person's state of health and pathology, the consequences of which are death, a life-threatening situation, or the probable occurrence of a permanent functional deficit, including a congenital anomaly or malformation (art. R. 1413-67 of decree no. 2016-1606 of 25 November 2016).

**Title:** Infectious Eruptive Diseases: Scarlet Fever  
**Description:** Epidemiology, Clinical Features, Complications and Referral, School Avoidance  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

**Epidemiology:**

- Scarlet fever is linked to the erythrogenic toxin of Group A Streptococcus (GAS = Streptococcus pyogenes).
- Predominantly affects children aged 5 to 10 and occurs more often in winter.
- Transmitted human-to-human via the respiratory route (oropharyngeal secretions, droplets).
- Several types of GAS produce different erythrogenic toxins, making it possible to have multiple types of scarlet fever.
- 80% of adults are immune to different types of toxin.

**Prevention:**

- Eviction from the community up to 48 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy.
- Oral antibiotic prophylaxis for subjects at risk of invasive infection (refer to HCSP opinion on invasive GAS infections).

(Note: Scarlet fever is not an invasive GAS infection but justifies antibiotic prophylaxis in subjects at risk.)

**Clinical Features:**

Two phases:

- **Pre-eruptive (Invasion):** High fever, marked general signs, erythematous or erythematopultaceous angina with a positive rapid diagnostic test, and cervical adenopathy preceding the eruption by about 24 hours.
- **Eruptive (6 days):** Diffuse erythema, confluent without a gap of healthy skin, with a granular appearance to the touch. Erythema is more marked in the flexion creases (axillary and inguinal), regressing with desquamation in large flaps (glove fingers). Accompanied by mucosal involvement (enanthema) with exfoliative glossitis (tongue initially sandy, then depilated, then raspberry) and angina.

**Complications and Referral:**

Complications are similar to those of GAS angina: loco-regional complications (rare) and post-infectious complications (acute glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever), which have largely disappeared in France and high-income countries.

Treatment is the same as for GAS angina: antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin for 6 days, symptomatic analgesic treatment avoiding NSAIDs, and preventive measures as outlined above.",1.0,9.55,False,True,0.738409161567688,0.7199938495953878,c,False,5,3

**Rubric:** Management  

==D'Amico Classification==

- In the majority of cases, prostate cancer is localized/locally advanced, i.e., confined to the prostate and not metastatic.
- The treatment strategy at this stage is curative according to the D'Amico classification of risk groups.

**To remember about the D'Amico classification:**

- Prognostic classification for localized or locally advanced but non-metastatic prostate cancer.
- Based on three criteria: digital rectal examination, PSA level, and ISUP group.
- Three risk groups (progression, recurrence):
  - Low risk
  - Intermediate risk
  - High risk

D'Amico's prognostic group depends on extension work-up and treatment.

**D'Amico Classification Table:**

- **Low Risk:** PSA ‚â§ 10 ng/ml, ISUP score 1, clinical stage T1c or T2a
- **Intermediate Risk:** PSA between 10 and 20 ng/ml, ISUP score 2 or 3, clinical stage T2b
- **High Risk:** PSA > 20 ng/ml, ISUP score > 3, clinical stage T2c

**Clinical Stages:**

- T1c: Normal rectal examination
- T2a: Abnormality of less than half a prostate lobe on digital rectal examination
- T2b: Abnormality of more than half of a single prostate lobe on rectal examination
- T2c: Abnormality of the two prostatic lobes on rectal examination

==Abstention-Surveillance==

- For frail patients with serious co-morbidities and limited life expectancy, abstention and monitoring are indicated.
- Patients are treated symptomatically when clinical signs related to cancer appear (e.g., pain).

==Active Surveillance==

- For low-risk cancers, it allows the avoidance of complications from more invasive treatments (e.g., urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, digestive transit disorders) without loss of chance.
- Involves performing PSA, TR, pelvic and prostate MRI, and iterative biopsies to ensure the disease is not progressing.
- Invasive curative treatment is indicated if the cancer progresses.
- Theoretical low risk of allowing aggressive cancer to progress.

==Total Prostatectomy==

- This is a curative surgical treatment involving the total removal of the prostate and seminal vesicles.
- Performed all at once, without neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment.
- Can be part of a multimodal treatment combining radiotherapy and hormone therapy for the most aggressive cancers.
- Risks include immediate surgical complications (e.g., haemorrhage, lymphocele, rectal wound, urinary fistula, thrombo-embolism, infection) and long-term functional complications:
  - Erectile dysfunction (most frequent complication)
  - Urinary incontinence (common after surgery but recovers in most cases)
  - Constant infertility and anejaculation
  - Stenosis of the urethrovesical anastomosis (rare)

==External Radiotherapy==

- Irradiation of the prostate cavity for curative purposes and of the pelvic lymph nodes for high-risk cancers.
- May be combined with temporary adjuvant hormone therapy (potentiation).
- Treatment involves daily radiotherapy for 4-6 weeks.
- Risks include increased lower urinary tract symptoms, haematuria, and rectal bleeding during treatment, as well as distant functional and post-radiation complications:
  - Stenosis of the urethra
  - Radiation-induced cystitis/rectitis
  - Erectile dysfunction (most frequent complication)
  - Secondary cancer
  - Urination problems
  - Digestive transit disorders

==Interstitial Brachytherapy==

- Permanent implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate via the perineal route, performed in a single session.
- Treatment with the lowest risk of causing erectile dysfunction.
- Side effects are similar to those of radiotherapy.

==Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)==

- Allows prostate tissue to be destroyed by ultrasound with low morbidity.
- Treatment can be partial or total, with the possibility of a second session if necessary.
- Procedure performed under general anaesthetic in a single session.
- Endoureteral resection is often associated with the procedure to reduce the risk of acute urine retention and severe dysuria.
- A first-line treatment currently being evaluated.

==Dynamic Phototherapy==

- Treatment under evaluation, not feasible outside clinical trials.

**The Indications According to D'Amico's Group (CC-AFU 2022-2024):**

Patients must be informed of treatment modalities and complications, benefits/risks of treatment. All files must be presented to the oncology RCP.

- **Localized Low Risk:** Active surveillance is recommended. Options include total prostatectomy, radiotherapy, brachytherapy. In clinical trials only: cryotherapy, HIFU. Hormonal treatment alone is not recommended.
- **Localized Intermediate Risk:** Total prostatectomy +/- curage, radiotherapy +/- hormone therapy for 6 months, brachytherapy. Active surveillance in selected cases. Cryotherapy and HIFU in clinical trials only. Hormonal treatment alone is not recommended.
- **Localized High Risk:** Long-term hormone therapy (18-36 months) with pelvic radiotherapy, total prostatectomy with curage. Cryotherapy and HIFU are not recommended.

The intensity of the clinical signs depends on the severity of the thyrotoxicosis, its duration, and the patient's condition. It is the combination of several disorders that prompts the diagnosis.

The main signs and symptoms associated with thyrotoxicosis in adults are:

- Agitation (SD-114) and sleep disorders
- Tachycardia (SD-166) at rest, regular, sinusoidal, with possible palpitations (SD-165)
- Asthenia (SD-021)
- Tremors
- Weight loss (SD-017) with preserved appetite
- Thermophobia, often accompanied by hypersudation (SD-025), sometimes with polydipsia
- Sometimes dyspnoea (SD-162) on exertion
- Muscular weakness leading to muscular fatigability (SD-074), which can result in amyotrophy, especially in the elderly
- Diarrhea (SD-002)

The ophthalmological signs are specific to Graves' disease and, apart from the glare which may occur regardless of the cause of the excess thyroid hormones, are observed in Graves' disease. They are mainly:

Vascular nephropathies are a group of heterogeneous diseases characterized by damage to the renal vessels. Some diseases involve the large vessels (obstruction of the renal arteries), while others affect the small vessels (nephroangiosclerosis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and cholesterol crystal embolism diseases). Drug prescription, follow-up consultation, and education of a hypertensive patient (SD-282) are often at the forefront. It may be the cause or consequence of kidney disease. Vascular nephropathies can be classified according to their rate of progression and the location of renal arterial damage.

**Classification of Vascular Nephropathies**

1. **Acute or Rapidly Progressive Vascular Nephropathies**  
   - Thrombotic microangiopathy syndrome (HUS, PTT)  
   - HTA and malignant nephroangiosclerosis (intrarenal vessels of all calibres)  
   - Cholesterol crystal emboli (small-calibre intrarenal arterioles)  
   - Acute occlusion of one or more renal arteries, causing renal infarction  
   - Macroscopic periarteritis nodosa (medium-calibre arterioles)  
   - Acute scleroderma crisis (intrarenal vessels of all calibres)  

2. **Vascular Nephropathies with a Chronic Course**  
   - Renal artery stenosis  
   - Benign nephroangiosclerosis (intrarenal vessels of all calibres)

**Torsion of the Spermatic Cord:**

- Spermatic cord torsion is a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency requiring immediate surgical scrotal exploration to confirm the diagnosis, remove the ischemia by untwisting the spermatic cord, and perform an orchidopexy if the testicle appears viable. Contralateral orchidopexy may be performed at the same time or at a later date. If the testicle is not viable, orchiectomy is necessary.
- No further investigations should delay surgical management.
- The patient and his family must be warned of the risk of orchiectomy and sequelae of testicular atrophy if the testicle has been preserved.

**Necrotizing Fasciitis:**

- The treatment of necrotizing fasciitis of the external genitalia is multidisciplinary, based on the following management options:
  - Medical: In an intensive care unit with antibiotic therapy combining C3G and an aminoglycoside combined with an anti-anaerobic antibiotic.
  - Surgical: Under general anesthetic as an emergency measure, with surgical debridement of necrotic tissue without any closure. A urinary or digestive diversion may be necessary.

== Role of Pharmacists ==

=== Validity of the Prescription ===
When a prescription is issued, the pharmacist must carry out several checks, including:

- Date of prescription
- Type of prescription (simple, secure, two-zone, or specific for ""exceptional drugs"")
- Dosage and duration of treatment
- Qualification of the prescriber, particularly if the pharmaceutical specialities are restricted prescription
- Conducting any prior or periodic examinations required for dispensing certain medicinal products.

=== Pharmaceutical Analysis ===
Pharmaceutical analysis must enable:

- Detection of possible drug interactions
- Assessment of the choice of a drug (compliance with recommendations, patient profile, etc.)
- Refusal to dispense a medicinal product when necessary for the patient's health.

=== Respecting the Prescription ===
According to article L.5125-23 of the CSP, ""the pharmacist may only dispense a medicinal product or product other than that which has been prescribed, or having a non-proprietary name different from the prescribed non-proprietary name, with the express prior agreement of the prescriber, except in an emergency and in the interest of the patient.""

Consequently, the pharmacist may only dispense a medicinal product other than that which has been prescribed with the express prior agreement of the prescriber, except in the event of an emergency and in the patient's best interests. In an emergency, the pharmacist must inform the prescriber as soon as possible.

=== Special Case of Generics ===
Since 1999, pharmacists have had the right, under certain conditions, to substitute a prescribed drug with a generic drug belonging to the same generic group. The aim of substitution is to generate savings for the Assurance Maladie.

== Role of Nurses ==
According to article R4312-42 du CSP: ""The nurse applies and respects the medical prescription which, except in emergencies, is written, quantitative, qualitative, dated, and signed."" They ask the prescriber for additional information whenever they consider it useful, particularly if they feel they have not been adequately informed. If the nurse has any doubt about the prescription, they check it with the prescriber or, if this is not possible, with another member of the profession concerned. In the event of impossibility of verification and of manifest and imminent risks to the patient's health, they shall adopt the attitude which best safeguards the patient's health and shall not cause the patient to take any unjustified risk.

=== Special Case of Hospitals ===
The role of nurses is different in the hospital circuit, as nurses are systematically involved, normally after pharmaceutical validation, with the medical prescription for all types of medicines. In outpatient medicine, nurses are only involved after the prescription for certain medicines, particularly injectables. Generally, in hospitals, most nursing acts relating to medicines, such as the administration of medicines, fall into the category of delegated acts, requiring a medical prescription (R4311-7 CSP) and not the specific role (R4311-5 CSP) of nursing staff.

== Responsibility of Those Involved Downstream of the Medical Prescription ==
On several occasions, the French courts have ruled that the ""execution of a prescription"" entails the ""liability"" of those involved downstream of the prescription and not that of the prescriber alone.

In certain circumstances, the courts have been able to simultaneously engage the liability of the prescriber and either a pharmacist or a nurse, whether before the civil or administrative courts (compensation for harm suffered by the victim in outpatient or hospital medicine) or before the criminal courts (punishment for an offence committed in both the private and public sectors), particularly for errors in dosage, indication, or the name of the medicine.

**Categories of Nevi:**

- **Common Melanocytic/Pigmentary/Acquired Nevi:** Commonly known as ""moles,"" these are the most prevalent melanocytic lesions. They are benign tumors composed of melanocytes grouped in clusters (theca) in the epidermis and/or dermis.

- **Congenital Nevi:** Present from birth and much rarer, occurring in 1% of births. The clinical appearance of a common nevus can vary in size, shape, and pigmentation, but typically, all nevi in an individual have a similar appearance.

Congenital nevi can vary significantly in size. Over time, their surface may become irregular with hypertrichosis. Large congenital nevi, defined as having a projected diameter of over 20 cm in adulthood, are rare. They can be giant, covering a large part of the body, often with a metameric distribution, most commonly dorsal.

- **Blue Nevus:** A deep dermal nevus with a high melanin load.

- **Achromic Nevi:** Unpigmented, usually tuberous, and predominantly located on the face or trunk.

**Factors Responsible for the Development of Nevi:**

- **Intrinsic Factors:**
  - Constitutional, genetic susceptibility
  - Correlation between the number of nevi and ethnic origin (more nevi in Caucasian > Asian > Black population)
  - Link between the number of nevi and phototype (most common: phototype II)
  - Family predisposition: density of nevi in children correlated with that of parents

- **Extrinsic Factors:**
  - Environmental, behavioral: correlation between the number of nevi and sun exposure
  - Immunological status: Immunodepression leads to an increase in the number of nevi",1.0,9.255714285714287,False,True,0.8177505135536194,0.5728726784388224,c,False,5,2

**Multidisciplinary Care in a Coordinated Network**  
This network must bring together all the skills required to manage the pregnancy and welcome the child:

- General practitioner
- Obstetrician, midwife
- Paediatrician
- Psychiatrist, psychologist
- Addictologist
- Tobacco midwife
- Midwife and PMI nursery nurse
- Social worker

It enables opiate substitution treatment to be introduced, withdrawal or a reduction in consumption depending on the substances concerned, and the pregnancy to be supported until term, minimizing the medico-psycho-social complications for the child and the mother.

**Opiate Substitution Treatments**

- Opioid substitution treatments improve medical and obstetrical follow-up and reduce maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality.
- However, pregnancy remains a high-risk pregnancy (prematurity, hypotrophy, withdrawal syndrome).
- Two products can be used: methadone (M√©thadone¬Æ in syrup or capsule form) and buprenorphine (generic Buprenorphine¬Æ or Subutex¬Æ in tablet form to be taken sublingually).
- Pending marketing authorization, Suboxone¬Æ, a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone also used as a substitution treatment, should be replaced as far as possible by Subutex¬Æ during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- Treatment must be prescribed at an effective dose to maintain stable levels and avoid withdrawal in the mother-to-be and the foetus.
- The increase in circulating volume at the end of pregnancy is accompanied by an increased need for opiates and usually requires an increase in dosage.
- The severity of the withdrawal syndrome is not related to the dosage of substitution treatment.

All these points should be explained to the mother-to-be at the start of the pregnancy and reiterated during follow-up consultations.

**Management of Other Addictions**

There are a number of possible approaches when substitution treatment is not available:

- Monitoring consumption: setting up a logbook to track consumption and record cravings, consumption, trigger events, etc.
- Possible use of an anxiolytic (""alcohol drug"", evening joint, etc.), giving preference to oxazepam (S√©resta¬Æ), a benzodiazepine with an intermediate half-life
- Motivational interview

**Rubric:** Management

=Beta Blockers: Mechanisms of Action, Indications, Side Effects, Drug Interactions, Monitoring Procedures, and Main Causes of Failure=

==Mechanisms of Action==

Beta-blockers are competitive antagonists of Œ≤-adrenergic receptors, classified according to their relative selectivity for Œ≤1 and Œ≤2 receptors. Some beta-blockers have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, enabling them to limit their bradycardia-inducing effect at rest and the risk of aggravating Raynaud's phenomenon.

===Systemic Route===

====Cardioselective Beta-blockers====

- **Without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity:** Atenolol, Betaxolol, Bisoprolol, Metoprolol, Esmolol, Nebivolol
- **With intrinsic sympathomimetic activity:** Acebutolol, Celiprolol

====Non-cardioselective Beta-blockers====

- **Without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity:** Propranolol, Nadolol, Sotalol*, Tertatolol, Timolol, Labetalol, Carvedilol
- **With intrinsic sympathomimetic activity:** Oxyprenolol, Kareolol, Pindolol

====Eye Drops (Antiglaucoma)====

Betaxolol, Karteolol, Metipranolol, Timolol, Levobunolol

*Sotalol is a particular non-selective Œ≤-blocker, prolonging the cardiac action potential by inhibiting IKr and lengthening the QT interval. It is used as an antiarrhythmic.

==Indications==

===Cardiovascular===

- Angina, myocardial infarction
- Atrial and ventricular rhythm disorders
- Heart failure: for metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and nebivolol. Treatment is started at a low dose and then gradually increased.
- Arterial hypertension: Compared with other antihypertensive drugs, Œ≤-blockers are equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events, but are less effective in preventing stroke. Œ≤-blockers are no longer a first-line treatment for essential hypertension. They are used as first-line treatment in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure, and when heart rate needs to be controlled.
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

===Other Information===

- Chronic open-angle glaucoma: first-line treatment (local administration in the form of eye drops).
- Migraine: background treatment as first-line treatment (metoprolol, propranolol).
- Thyrotoxicosis: adjuvant treatment.
- Treatment of somatic manifestations of anxiety
- Preventive treatment of ruptured oesophageal varices

==Undesirable Effects==

- Frequent asthenia, bradycardia, cold extremities, and Raynaud's phenomenon
- Frequent insomnia and nightmares. Œ≤-blockers are not responsible for depressive episodes.
- Rare atrioventricular conduction disorders.
- Bronchoconstriction, rare
- Prolongation/masking of hypoglycaemia in diabetics on sulphonamides or insulin, rare.
- Risk of aggravation of heart failure, rare.
- Psoriasis, exceptional.
- Rebound effect on abrupt cessation of treatment: tachycardia, high blood pressure, sweating, nervousness. In practice, doses should be gradually reduced until treatment is stopped.
- After administration in the form of eye drops, absorption through the ocular and nasal mucosa is possible, which may lead to the undesirable effects described above.

==Drug Interactions==

Mainly pharmacodynamic interactions.

==Contraindications==

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. However, the benefit/risk balance of progressively-dosed cardioselective Œ≤-blockers in these patients with coronary artery disease is positive, at the cost of iatrogenicity.
- Uncontrolled heart failure
- Bradycardia and second- and third-degree atrioventricular block without equipment
- Prinzmetal's angina
- Severe Raynaud's phenomenon
- In moderate arteriopathy of the lower limbs, the benefit/risk balance is favourable for cardioselective Œ≤-blockers.
- Hypotension

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Identification of the emergency

**In Practice:**

- Any sudden acute headache is investigated as an aneurysmal SAH.
- Any acute progressive headache should be investigated as HTIC.
- Any acute febrile headache is investigated as meningitis.
- Investigations are carried out in the emergency department, sometimes after the patient has been transferred to a center with the necessary imaging capabilities (angioscanner).

**The Patient is Hospitalized If:**

- A diagnosis of severe secondary headache is made, and the assessment and etiological treatment are continued.
- If the diagnosis has not been established and the severe headache persists, to continue investigating the etiology and adapting the treatment, following specialist advice.

Investigations are normal in 30 to 70% of patients seen in emergency departments for a recent unusual headache. If the patient is relieved, they can go home. This is often the first severe migraine attack.

**Indications for a Lumbar Puncture in the Event of an Acute Headache:**

This allows the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to be analyzed and the intracranial pressure to be measured. LP must be performed with a reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination:

- **Suspicion of SAH:** If the imaging is normal, an LP must be performed, even if the headache has disappeared. Xanthochromia of the supernatant in spectrophotometry is present in 100% of aneurysmal SAHs when the CSF is taken between 12 hours and 14 days after the onset of the headache.
  
- **When Infectious Meningitis is Suspected:** Perform LP from the outset without prior imaging or blood tests. There are few indications for brain imaging prior to LP. A blood test is carried out at the same time (blood culture and systematic blood glucose to interpret the glycorrhaphy).

- **When There is a Suspicion of HTIC:** After non-diagnostic brain imaging, an LP must be performed to confirm the diagnosis by measuring pressure in the left lateral decubitus position (HTIC if >25 cm of water), to look for chronic meningitis and to relieve the headache by subtracting CSF. A fundus examination will also be carried out.

- After imaging in all other acute headaches without a definite etiological diagnosis after imaging.

**Lumbar Puncture is the Key Emergency Test for Any Suspected Case of Infectious Meningitis (Severe Headache + Fever):**

- It must be carried out within one hour of the patient's admission to the emergency department, without any prior brain imaging or biological work-up.
- Isolated disorder of consciousness is NOT a contraindication to LP.
- Indications for brain imaging prior to LP are rare.
- If an LP cannot be performed as quickly as possible, dexamethasone and antibiotics should be started immediately after a pair of blood cultures have been taken.

**LP is NOT Contraindicated If:**

- Disturbed consciousness is isolated.
- Taking anti-platelet agents.

**LP is Contraindicated If:**

- Extensive cutaneous infection of the puncture site.
- Hemodynamic or respiratory instability.
- Known hemostasis disorders (coagulopathy including hemophilia, platelets < 50,000/mm¬≥).
- Effective anticoagulant treatment (heparin, VKA or direct oral anticoagulants).
- Spontaneous bleeding suggestive of DIC.

**If Meningitis is Suspected, the Indications for Imaging Before LP are Limited:**

- Signs suggestive of an expansive process: signs of localization and/or recent focal epileptic seizures.
- Signs of cerebral involvement: disturbances of consciousness and pupillary abnormalities, dysautonomia, posterior tonic seizures, areactivity, decerebration or decortication reaction.
- Persistence of convulsive crises.

**Title:** Knowing the Therapeutic Principles of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Management  

== Therapeutic Principles of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) ==  
Identification of an AAA leads to:  

- Ultrasound monitoring at intervals appropriate to its diameter  
- Conventional or endovascular surgical intervention if necessary  
- Search for other aneurysms, particularly popliteal, iliac, and thoracic aorta  
- Screening for AAA in children and 1st-degree relatives over the age of 50  
- Smoking cessation and control of cardiovascular risk factors  
- Assessment of other sites of atherosclerotic disease  

=== Medical Management ===  
There is no specific drug treatment to limit growth, reduce diameter, or prevent AAA rupture.  

Smoking cessation is imperative, as smoking promotes the growth and rupture of the aneurysm. It is essential to control other cardiovascular risk factors.  

As the risk factors for AAA are the same as those for atherosclerosis, patients with AAA are at risk of coronary and neurovascular disease. The associated drug treatment consists of preventing the complications of atherosclerosis: prescription of a statin, antiplatelet treatment, and an ACE inhibitor/ARB2 for the control of hypertension.  

=== Monitoring of AAA ===  
The monitoring schedule for asymptomatic AAA depends on its maximum diameter and the value at which the indication for surgery is discussed:  

- Maximum diameter less than 40 mm: surveillance ultrasound every year  
- Maximum diameter between 40 and 49 mm: surveillance ultrasound every 6 months  

From 50 mm, the indication for surgery is discussed.  

=== Surgical Management ===  
The aim of surgical treatment of AAA is to prevent it from rupturing.  

- In men, it is discussed from a maximum diameter of 50 mm.  
- In women, it may be discussed for a diameter of less than 50 mm, as the risk of rupture is higher in women of the same diameter.  
- In men and women, it is indicated in cases of rapid growth (more than 1 cm in one year), or in cases of complicated aneurysms.  

The pre-operative assessment includes an overall cardiovascular evaluation and an assessment of renal and respiratory function.  

Two surgical techniques are currently used: conventional surgery and endovascular surgery.  

- Conventional surgical treatment involves flattening the graft. After laparotomy or lumbotomy, aortic clamping, opening of the AAA shell, and removal of the thrombus, a prosthetic tube is sutured to the healthy aorta above and below the aneurysm to reconstruct the aorta.  
- Endovascular surgical treatment is less invasive. It involves intra-arterial femoral insertion of a suitable stent graft, which is deployed in the aneurysm. A seal is achieved proximally, on a segment of healthy aorta above the AAA and below the renal arteries (collar), and distally, in the iliac arteries. Exclusion of the aneurysm by stent grafting requires specific anatomical conditions, which limit the indications. Endovascular treatment is preferred in patients at high risk of surgery. If the anatomy is favorable, it may be offered to low-risk patients.  

=== Follow-up After AAA Exclusion ===  
Follow-up after surgery depends on the type of operation:  

- The prostheses used in conventional surgery may be complicated by anastomotic aneurysms requiring annual monitoring by Doppler ultrasound.  
- The endoprostheses require long-term monitoring by ultrasound-Doppler or angio-CT to detect the presence of endoleaks, migration, or limb folds, which may be complicated by occlusion.  

The survival rate of patients, even after surgery, is lower than that of the general population. This excess mortality is explained by advanced age, cardiovascular risk factors, associated atherosclerosis, COPD, and other post-smoking pathologies.  

Medical monitoring of the patient undergoing surgery must detect the secondary occurrence or evolution of other localizations of aneurysmal disease or atheromatous disease.  

This medical management is based on the control of risk factors and the prevention of cardiovascular risk by medication (statin, antiplatelet, ACE inhibitor/ARB2).",0.6666666666666666,10.941428571428574,False,True,0.7698031663894653,0.7305871645609537,b,False,4,3

**Lifestyle**  
Therapeutic lifestyle changes consist of encouraging venous return to reduce venous hyperpressure and apply to all stages of venous insufficiency and varicose veins:

- Raising the legs, raising the feet of the bed by 7-10 cm
- Combatting a sedentary lifestyle
- Walking regularly every day
- Avoiding crossing legs when sitting
- Avoiding prolonged standing
- Managing overweight and obesity
- Avoiding underfloor heating, hot baths, and prolonged sun exposure
- Managing constipation

**Elastic Compression**  
This involves applying pressure to a segment of the limb using elastic materials such as bands, socks, self-fastening stockings, or tights. The pressure decreases from the ankle to the thigh. It is most effective when applied in the morning, within an hour of getting up. Application may require devices or assistance.

There are four classes of elastic compression based on ankle pressure:  
- Class I: 10-15 mmHg  
- Class II: 15.1-20 mmHg  
- Class III: 20.1-36 mmHg  
- Class IV: >36 mmHg  

Functional CVI is an indication for class I compression, while lymphatic insufficiency requires class IV. Contraindications include obliterative arterial disease with SPI < 0.60, septic venous thrombosis, phlegmatia caerulae, and diabetic microangiopathy with TcPO2 < 30 mmHg. Regular reassessment of the benefit/risk ratio is essential in certain cases.

**Clinical Situations and Compression Devices**  
- Varicose veins > 3 mm: Class II or III socks, thigh-highs, pantyhose (Long-term use)  
- After sclerotherapy, heat treatment, or stripping: Class II or III lower thigh (4 to 6 weeks)  
- Chronic oedema of venous origin: Class III socks, thigh-highs, tights (Long-term, regular re-evaluation)  
- Pigmentation, eczema: Class III socks, thigh-highs, tights  
- Lipodermatosclerosis, venous hypodermatitis, white atrophy: Class III socks, thigh-highs, tights  
- Healed ulcer: Class III or IV socks, thigh-highs, tights  
- Open ulcer: Multi-type bandages as first-line treatment, Class III or IV socks, thigh-highs, tights (Until complete healing)

**Drug Treatment**  
Venotonic drugs are prescribed for functional symptoms like discomfort and heaviness in the legs, as an adjunct to a healthy lifestyle and elastic compression. They are prescribed for short periods.

**Sclerotherapy, Endovenous Thermal Techniques, and Surgery**  
These treatments are for symptomatic varicose veins and aim to ""destroy"" pathological veins. The patient's condition and cardiovascular risk factors must be considered. The choice of technique depends on the location, appearance, and diameter of the varicose veins.

**Sclerotherapy**  
Involves injecting a sclerosing agent into a varicose vein, possibly under ultrasound control. It is indicated from CEAP stage C2 upwards. Complications include haematoma and pigmentation sequelae. The benefit/risk balance must be assessed, and patients must be informed.

**Endovenous Thermal Techniques**  
These techniques (laser or radiofrequency) have replaced traditional surgery and are first-line when sclerotherapy is not indicated. They can be done without general anaesthesia and allow quick resumption of activities.

**Surgery**  
Indications for surgery are limited. Techniques include stripping and phlebectomy. Stripping is for extensive forms and requires anaesthesia and time off work. Phlebectomies involve removing superficial varicose veins under local anaesthetic.

**Crenotherapy or Spa Treatment**  
Crenotherapy may be proposed as an adjuvant treatment in cases with significant skin repercussions or disabling post-thrombotic syndrome after other treatments.",0.8888888888888888,14.630000000000003,False,True,0.8169059753417969,0.6301082173983256,b,False,4,3

== Definitions ==

Chronic complications of BPH should be investigated and treated surgically.

- Chronic retention of urine is suggested by the presence of a bladder globe which is not painful. In extreme cases, this retention leads to overflow micturition with urine leakage. It is confirmed by a reno-vesico-prostatic ultrasound (bladder with post-micturition residue > 150 cc). A differential diagnosis such as detrusor hypoactivity must be ruled out. The obstructive or acontractile origin of chronic retention can be differentiated by a dynamic urological assessment.

- Stasis lithiasis is linked to the presence of a chronic post-mictional residue which encourages the crystallization of urine. It leads to an increase in UABS and, more specifically, dysuria, and may be complicated by urinary tract infections or macroscopic haematuria. It is confirmed by renal-vesicoprostatic ultrasound (hyperechoic image).

- The diagnosis of obstructive renal failure complicating BPH is based on renal-vesicoprostatic ultrasound, which shows bilateral dilatation of the pyelo-caliceal cavities, with alteration of the renal parenchyma, upstream of the subvesical obstruction, and an increase in creatinine levels in the biological work-up. There may be clinical signs of renal failure (oedema, weight gain, hypertension, nausea, etc.).

- Dysuria linked to the symptom of bladder emptying is associated with chronic abdominal thrusts which may be complicated by a groin hernia.

There are two types of ECG recording:

- **Percritical ECG:**  
  - Concomitant with palpitations, allows an electroclinical correlation to be established. This is the only way of obtaining a definite diagnosis.
  - Because palpitations are often transient in nature, it is rarely obtained on admission to the emergency department or on consultation.
  - If it cannot be obtained during the initial treatment, a Holter ECG is performed, with a recording time of 24 to 96 hours in the case of frequent palpitations (>1/week) or a long-term ambulatory ECG (7 to 21 days) in the case of less frequent symptoms.
  - If triggering circumstances are identified, a recording should be made under the usual conditions in which the palpitations occur, to make the examination more sensitive (e.g., stress test).

- **Inter-Critical ECG:**  
  - Carried out without palpitations, the ECG is often normal.
  - However, it can also provide clues as to the mechanism of the palpitations (e.g., ST segment elevation, ventricular pre-excitation, etc.).",1.0,10.941428571428574,False,True,0.7831334471702576,0.7239274382591248,a,False,2,3

Nutritional advice must be adapted to cultural, ethnic, and family traditions, as well as to professional constraints, and is inseparable from the action of insulin therapy. Prescription of insulin therapy, follow-up consultation, and education of a type 1 diabetic patient (SD-280).

Carbohydrate intake is defined for each patient based on weight, eating habits, glycaemic profile, and insulin regimen.

The diet should be varied and divided into three main meals, supplemented if necessary by one or two snacks. Snacks are essential during intense physical activity.

The main aim of dietetics in type 1 diabetes is to avoid excessive fluctuations in blood sugar levels, either through the consumption of products with a high glycaemic index or through an inadequate intake of carbohydrates at meals or during physical exercise, which could lead to hypoglycaemia (SD-209) or hyperglycaemia (SD-208).

Patients must learn to take sugar again in the event of hypoglycaemia.

Regular physical activity promotes a better metabolic balance. It requires education to avoid hypo- and hyperglycaemia at the time of sport and/or afterwards. A clinical assessment is necessary when resuming an activity after a long period of inactivity.

Diabetes can cause personal and family distress. Psychological support can improve metabolic control.

**Description:** Distinguish between the different anatomical and clinical entities of melanoma and be familiar with the histopronostic criteria and their prognostic implications. Knowledge of the main clinical factors with a poor prognosis.  
**Rubric:** Follow-up and/or Prognosis  

**Definitions**  
There are five main histological types of melanoma:

- Superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) accounts for 60-70% of melanomas. It is characterized by an initial phase of horizontal intraepidermal spread followed by secondary vertical dermal spread.
- Nodular melanoma (15 to 20% of cases), which initially spreads vertically and has a poor prognosis.
- Lentiginous acral melanoma (5%): melanoma of the palms and soles.
- Dubreuilh melanoma (10%): melanoma occurring in elderly subjects with marked helioderma, especially on the face.
- Melanoma of the genital, ENT, and oral mucosa: very rare.

**Risk of Recurrence**  
Melanoma has a risk of:

- Skin recurrence, in the form of skin or subcutaneous nodules at the initial site of the melanoma or ""in transit"" between the tumor and the first lymph node relay.
- Lymph node metastases in the homolateral drainage area of the melanoma.
- Distant metastases, which generally occur after regional lymph node metastases and can affect any organ, with a predilection for the lungs, liver, and brain.

**Classification**  
The international classification (AJCC 8th edition) classifies melanomas into:

- Stages I and II in cases of primary melanoma of the skin without lymph node or distant recurrence.
- Stage III in the case of locoregional, cutaneous, or lymph node involvement.
- Stage IV, in the presence of distant metastases.

**Prognostic Factors**  
The risk of regional and distant recurrence is correlated with histoprognostic parameters such as the Breslow index and ulceration.

At the stage of lymph node involvement (Stage III), the prognostic markers are the number and size of invaded lymph nodes and capsular rupture.

In Stage IV, the poor prognostic factors are a high LDH level, a large tumor mass (more than 3 organs affected by metastases; more than 3 liver metastases), and symptomatic brain metastases and/or more than 3 brain metastases.",0.09090909090909091,19.349999999999998,False,True,0.7683553099632263,0.7116018136342367,d,False,2,4

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Emergency Identification  

In the event of a decrease in visual acuity with a white, painless eye, a fundus examination guides the diagnosis and treatment.

1. **Fundus Not Visible or Poorly Visible:** Intravitreal haemorrhage.  
   The cause of the haemorrhage is easy to recognize when the retina remains visible. A massive haemorrhage renders the retina invisible on fundus examination. If the retina is not visible, B-ultrasound should be performed to rule out retinal detachment.  
   The main causes of intravitreal haemorrhage are as follows:
   - Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
   - Occlusions of the central retinal vein or one of its branches
   - Retinal tearing, whether or not complicated by retinal detachment
   - Terson's syndrome: Uni- or bilateral intravitreal haemorrhage associated with meningeal haemorrhage due to rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (Terson's syndrome may also be associated with meningeal haemorrhage of traumatic origin).

2. **Clearly Visible and Abnormal Fundus:**  
   - Occlusion of the central retinal artery or one of its branches: This is a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and, as such, the patient should be admitted urgently to a neurovascular unit to prevent another life-threatening vascular event. It should look for carotid atheroma and embologenic heart disease. In a young patient, a carotid dissection should also be sought.
   - Occlusion of the central retinal vein or one of its branches
   - AMD complicated by macular choroidal neovessels: This requires rapid initiation (within a few days of diagnosis) of treatment with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF.
   - Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD): The spontaneous evolution is very negative, with the detached retina suffering irreversible damage within a few weeks. A recent RD is a surgical ""semi-emergency"", justifying an operation within a few days of diagnosis, often less than a week when the macula is detached and even more urgent when the macula is still flat.
   - Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NOIA): This must be ruled out as an emergency.

**Description:** Being a victim of discrimination (linked to sexuality, lifestyle choices, physical appearance, cultural origin, etc.) negatively impacts socio-economic integration and mental and physical health.  
**Rubric:** Definition  

**Discrimination Accentuates the Social Determinants of Health**

Social inequalities in health arise from historical processes of social and economic exclusion based on origins, religion, socio-economic status, gender, mental health status, sexual orientation, etc. The influence of living environment and social identity on the onset of disease creates a social gradient in health.

Health is socially determined: ""International relations and national policies determine the organization of society at national and local levels, creating social statuses and a hierarchy. Populations are organized according to income, education, employment, gender, ethnic origin, and other factors. The position of individuals on the social ladder influences the conditions in which they grow up, learn, live, work, and age, and their vulnerability to disease and its consequences."" (WHO, Commission on Social Determinants of Health).

For example, difficulties in accessing housing or employment, a polluted and noisy living environment, and experiences of exclusion or inequality can all contribute to a multiplier effect.

**Discrimination Increases Stress**

Experiencing discrimination contributes to stress, which can result in poorer cardiovascular health. According to a meta-analysis (Paradies 2015), people exposed to ethno-racial discrimination are in poorer health. This discrimination is a risk factor for depressive, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms, as well as suicidal behavior (Bardol et al. 2020). These experiences can accumulate and 'wear down' individuals (Wilkinson 2015). The accumulation of disadvantages has a corrosive dimension (Pelet, Charles, and Dergham 2020).

Discrimination can also make it difficult for professionals to practice, particularly due to the tension between ethical requirements and the reality on the ground.

**Discrimination as a Major Contributor to Non-Take-Up**

Non-take-up occurs when people affected by public policies do not use the benefits or services to which they are entitled. This is widespread, particularly in healthcare. Beyond factors like geographical distance, territorial disparities, and unequal health literacy, discrimination can directly contribute to non-take-up. Anticipating rejection, stigmatizing remarks, and financial barriers, people from vulnerable populations and/or economically precarious situations may avoid seeking professional help, delaying treatment or worsening their health. Some individuals face barriers that prevent them from accessing care and may no longer find their place in the social protection and healthcare system, rejecting the nature of the interactions it offers.",1.0,18.11058823529412,False,True,0.738670825958252,0.603978157043457,c,False,4,1

== Definitions ==

=== 1. Resting Tremor (or Parkinsonian Tremor) ===  
Resting tremor, also known as Parkinsonian tremor, is present at rest and disappears during muscle contraction and sleep. It is slow (4-6 Hz), affects the limbs distally, the lips or chin, but never the head or voice. It is unilateral or asymmetric and is aggravated by emotions and mental calculation. This tremor is highly suggestive of Parkinson's disease, secondary to damage to the nigrostriatal pathway, but is not mandatory for diagnosis.

Trembling can be linked to other causes of parkinsonian syndrome, particularly Wilson's disease or iatrogenic parkinsonian syndrome. If Parkinson's disease is strongly suspected and the patient is over 40, no further tests are necessary. Conversely, brain MRI and a copper panel including cupraemia, ceruloplasminaemia, and 24-hour cupruria are necessary before the age of 40 to rule out Wilson's disease.

=== 2. Action Tremor ===  
- Present when maintaining a posture (postural tremor) and/or arriving at the target (intentional tremor).  
- The most common cause of postural tremor is essential tremor.  
- This is an action tremor, both postural and intentional, bilateral and symmetrical, mainly affecting the upper limbs and the head. It progresses slowly over several years and sometimes decades. It is seen when the patient writes, reproduces a spiral, maintains a posture such as stretching their hands out in front of them (the outstretched arm manoeuvre, also known as the oath manoeuvre), or bringing their index fingers together horizontally (the swordsman manoeuvre). It can be a handicap when performing everyday activities (such as eating) and can cause psychosocial embarrassment.

=== 3. Cerebellar Tremor ===  
- This is an action tremor that appears or is maximal upon arrival at the target (intention tremor).  
- Its frequency is around 3 Hz. It is triggered by an intentional action (e.g., drinking a glass of water, finger-nose test).  
- Other cerebellar symptoms may be identified: dysarthria, dyschronometric asynergy, hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia with dancing of the tendons on standing without worsening when the eyes are occluded (negative Romberg manoeuvre), and walking and balance disorders. Cerebellar gait is often identified during the assessment of the onset of walking difficulties and is characterised by a disturbance of balance with a widening of the sustentation polygon, lurching, instability, and incoordination of movements.  
- In the event of an acute cerebellar syndrome, vitamin B1 should be measured/supplemented to search for/treat Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy, which may cause mental confusion/disorientation.  
- Acute drunkenness is a frequent cause of acute cerebellar syndrome and warrants prevention of alcohol-related risks.  
- The acute onset of a cerebellar syndrome warrants a cerebral imaging test to search for a cerebellar ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, which may cause compression of the fourth ventricle responsible for hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension, potentially leading to sensory and/or motor neurological deficit.

=== 4. Exaggeration of Physiological Tremor ===  
Exaggeration of the physiological trembling can occur due to adverse drug reactions or care. Particular circumstances such as hyperthyroidism (analysis of thyroid balance with TSH measurement) or excessive caffeine consumption may cause an exaggeration of the physiological tremor, which is a normal phenomenon of muscular origin, not linked to an attack on the central nervous system.

=== 5. Functional (or Psychogenic) Tremor ===  
This tremor does not correspond to any neurological pathology described above. It is usually characterised by a sudden onset, often in an emotional context or in a patient with psychological fragility. It shows distractibility (disappears or changes during a competing task) and frequency entrainment (adopts the same frequency during a motor task performed by the contralateral limb). It may be present both at rest and in action, may disappear spontaneously, and may be polymorphous and atypical. It tends to occur in people with a history of somatisation.",0.3333333333333333,7.773333333333333,False,True,0.7817952632904053,0.5940842231114706,c,False,2,4

## I. Positive Diagnosis: Localised Oedema

### A. Clinical Signs

Localised oedema can be distinguished from generalised oedema by:

- Sometimes unilateral or asymmetrical presentation
- Less redistribution depending on the gradient
- Appearance may be inflammatory, hard, painful, less well absorbed by the cup, or even cardboard-like
- Possible existence of ochre dermatitis or signs of associated post-phlebitic or varicose disease

### B. Diagnosis of Localised Oedema

Questioning and clinical examination look for signs pointing to:

- An increase in venous pressure:
  - Thrombophlebitis and its after-effects
  - Venous insufficiency (varicose disease)
- Certain medications: mainly calcium channel blockers such as dihydropyridine
- A lymphatic obstacle:
  - Cancer (pelvic or breast) with lymph node invasion
  - Filariasis
- Local inflammatory pathology:
  - Skin infection such as erysipelas
  - Algodystrophy
  - Insect bite, trauma, allergy, etc.

## II. Diagnosis of Generalised Oedema

### A. Clinical Signs

Generalised oedema is evident when hydro-sodium retention is at least 3 to 5% of body weight (i.e., 2.5 to 3 litres). They are located in the subcutaneous tissues and are:

- Bilateral and symmetrical
- Declining:
  - In orthostatism in the lower limbs, initially in the ankles where they erase the retro-malleolar groove
  - After a period of prolonged bed rest, they are located preferentially in the lumbar region. In young patients, palpebral and periorbital oedema is frequently observed, particularly on rising
- White, soft, painless
- Taking the bucket: pressure of the finger against the inside of the tibia leaves a depression

Sodium and water inflation can also lead to hydrops with associated serous effusions:

- Pleural effusions
- Ascites, especially in children
- Exceptionally pericardial effusion

The extent of the oedematous syndrome is assessed by quantifying the weight gain (SD-057).

### In Favour of Cardiac Pathology:

- Jugular turgidity and hepato-jugular reflux: right heart failure or congestive heart failure
- Functional signs suggestive of associated left heart failure (dyspnoea on exertion or at rest), pathology potentially responsible for heart failure (myocardial ischaemia, valvular pathology, particularly mitral or aortic), risk factors for atherosclerosis
- Pleural effusions, mainly on the right
- Association of pulmonary oedema
- Cardiac ultrasound (reduced ejection fraction, etc.)
- Electrocardiogram
- Thoracic radiography (possible alveolar overload)

### In Favour of Liver Pathology:

- Ascites
- Alcohol intoxication
- Known acute or chronic viral hepatitis
- Ultrasound examination of the liver and bile ducts

### In Favour of Renal Failure:

- Elevated creatinine levels
- Known glomerular disease, arterial hypertension
- Proteinuria, haematuria (urine dipstick)
- Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract

### In Favour of Hypoalbuminemia (Favouring Factor):

#### Protein Synthesis Deficiency:

- Anorexia or lack of intake, signs of Kwashiorkor
- Digestive disease (severe malabsorption)
- Liver disease (hepatocellular insufficiency)

#### Loss of Protein:

- Known nephrotic syndrome (urine dipstick)
- Exudative enteropathy, cachexia (cancer)
- Extensive burns

### In Favour of Idiopathic Cyclic Oedema:

- Cardiac, hepatic, and renal pathologies have been ruled out
- Women in active periods, rapid weight gain in a few days or during the day of 1.5 to 2 kg; they are located in a remote area and are often linked to the menstrual cycle, oliguria",1.0,17.793333333333333,False,True,0.8323546051979065,0.6375808715820312,c,False,3,4

The pathophysiology of adrenal insufficiency varies according to the etiology:

- In the context of 21 hydroxylase block: The enzyme responsible for converting progesterone into 11 desoxycorticosterone (DOC), a precursor of aldosterone, and 17 hydroxyprogesterone into 11 desoxycortisol (compound S), a precursor of cortisol, is absent. This absence leads to a deficit in cortisol, resulting in adrenal insufficiency, and aldosterone, leading to salt loss and dehydration. Additionally, there is an accumulation of precursors upstream of the block, causing an elevation of androgens (17 OH progesterone) and resulting in hyperandrogenism and virilization in young girls.

- In the context of adrenoleukodystrophy: A mutation of a gene encoding a transporter of very long-chain fatty acids in the peroxisome leads to an accumulation of these molecules in the cells.",0.6666666666666666,13.073333333333338,False,True,0.7944002151489258,0.6861963669459025,c,False,5,3

- Check that there is no loss of ejaculate, particularly the first fraction, which is the richest in spermatozoa.
- Inquire about any particular events in the 3 months preceding the collection, especially a febrile episode.

Then, 30 to 60 minutes after collection, several parameters are analyzed:

- Measuring ejaculate volume
- Evaluation of ejaculate viscosity
- Measuring the pH of the ejaculate
- Evaluation of sperm mobility according to WHO recommendations, in 3 categories: progressive mobility (PR), non-progressive mobility (NP), immobile spermatozoa (I)
- Search for agglutinates (attachments of motile spermatozoa)
- Calculation of concentration (spermatozoa and round cells)
- Vitality assessment using vital dyes
- Spermocytogram to assess sperm morphology after staining on slides (several classifications are possible with different normality thresholds: strict criteria classification known as the Kr√ºger international classification or the modified David French classification)

The reference values were defined by the WHO after analyzing thousands of ejaculates from fertile men (spontaneous pregnancy within 12 months) from all over the world. It is important to point out to patients that lower values do not necessarily mean infertility or sterility.

**Description:** Savoir expliquer la prescription d'un m√©dicament g√©n√©rique ou d'un biosimilaire  
**Rubric:** Prescribing  

== Generic Drug ==  
A generic drug is a drug for which the patent on the active ingredient has expired and is therefore in the public domain. It can be freely produced by a pharmaceutical laboratory, provided it has the same qualitative and quantitative composition of active ingredients as the originator drug. It must also have the same pharmaceutical form (tablet, capsule, oral solution, etc.) and demonstrate identical pharmacokinetic characteristics to the originator, as shown in a bioequivalence study. Generic medicines may contain different excipients from the originator. Notable excipients are listed to help prescribers decide whether to replace an originator drug with a generic drug. The appearance, color, and taste of a generic drug may differ from the originator drug. In most cases, the generic drug is identified by the international non-proprietary name (INN), the name of the laboratory, the strength, and the pharmaceutical form of the drug. Substituting a generic drug for an originator drug serves the economic purpose of controlling healthcare costs.

== Authorisation of Generic Medicinal Products ==  
Generic medicines have a simplified marketing authorisation (MA) procedure. Marketing authorisation for these medicines is obtained for the indication of the originator medicine based on the pharmaceutical dossier and bioequivalence studies. These studies must be randomised, cross-over, and single-dose. Bioequivalence is achieved if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean of the maximum concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the generic drug are within the range of 80-125% of those of the originator drug. For medicines with a narrow therapeutic margin, the acceptance margin in bioequivalence studies is reduced to an interval of 90-111%.

== Substitution of a Generic Drug ==  
Generic drugs are listed in the generics register in groups containing the reference drug and the various authorised generic drugs. Substitutions of medicines are only possible within the same generic group. Substitutions may be made between the reference drug and a drug in the generic group, or between generic drugs.

Prescriptions must be in INN, and the prescribing doctor or the pharmacist dispensing the medicine is authorised to substitute a medicine with a generic. The prescriber and/or pharmacist making the substitution must consider the presence of excipients with a known effect when making the substitution:

- If the medicinal product to be substituted does not contain an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic product that does not contain such an excipient should be prescribed/dispensed in preference.
- If the medicinal product to be substituted contains an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic containing the same excipient or a generic without such an excipient should be prescribed/dispensed.

== Refusal to Substitute ==  
Under specific conditions requiring medical justification, the prescribing doctor may refuse to allow a generic drug to be substituted for a prescription. In this case, ""non-substitutable"" must be written on the prescription. This objection to substitution is only possible in three situations:

- Prescription in children under 6 years of age when there is no suitable galenic form.
- Prescription in a patient with a contraindication to an excipient of the generic medicinal product if this excipient is present in all the specialities of the generic group and is not present in the composition of the originator.
- Prescription of a medicinal product with a narrow therapeutic margin, the list of which is defined by decree, in a patient whose treatment with this medicinal product is balanced.

Pharmacists are authorised to substitute a drug with a generic from the same group if the drug is not labelled ""non-substitutable"" and if this substitution does not result in additional costs for the health insurance scheme.

== Biosimilar Medicinal Product ==  
A biosimilar medicinal product is a biological medicinal product (involving a biological source, protein, or cell, for their production) with the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance and the same pharmaceutical form as a reference biological medicinal product which has obtained marketing authorisation. The biological nature, complexity of the molecule, and difficulty in producing these medicines mean that this type of medicine does not meet the conditions for being considered a generic medicine.

== Authorisation of Biosimilar Medicinal Products ==  
Biosimilar medicinal products require additional preclinical and clinical pharmacodynamic and toxicological data proving comparability in terms of pharmacological mode of action, efficacy, and clinical safety. As these are biological medicinal products, it is also essential to study their immunogenicity.

If a biosimilar medicinal product demonstrates, in an indication deemed to be representative, comparable efficacy and a comparable safety profile to a reference biological medicinal product, this biosimilar medicinal product may obtain, by extrapolation, authorisation for the other indications approved for the reference biological medicinal product (e.g., marketing authorisation for biosimilars of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha in all the indications of the reference biological medicinal product after demonstration of its efficacy and safety in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis).

== Interchangeability of Biosimilar Medicinal Products ==  
By definition, a biosimilar medicinal product cannot be substituted in the same way as a generic medicinal product, since it is not an exact copy of the reference medicinal product. However, these biosimilar medicines are 'interchangeable' at the prescriber's initiative. This interchangeability is possible at any time during a patient's treatment but requires informing the patient and obtaining their consent, recording the change to a biosimilar in the patient's file, and ensuring appropriate monitoring after the change to the biosimilar.",1.0,13.945882352941176,False,True,0.7918117642402649,0.6650858521461487,c,False,5,3

**Title:** Know how to define and identify the clinical manifestations of acute complete or incomplete ischaemia.

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

**Definitions**

Acute ischaemia is the sudden interruption of arterial flow to a limb resulting in tissue ischaemia. It is an absolute therapeutic emergency, where any delay in starting appropriate treatment exposes the patient to the risk of amputation or even death.

The diagnosis is clinical. Complementary examinations have little place if they delay revascularisation.

The ultimate criterion of severity is paralysis. Palpation of the pulses allows the topography of the arterial occlusion to be determined. The image depicts the clinical presentation of acute ischaemia.

Acute ischaemia is said to be complete if there is sensory-motor damage. It is characterised by:

- Intense spontaneous pain in a limb, with a sudden or rapidly progressive onset, intense grinding pain, accompanied by functional impotence of the limb, poorly relieved by conventional analgesics.
- Limb colour abnormalities, such as pale, cold, livid, or even cadaveric appearance.
- Abolition of peripheral pulses downstream of the occlusion.

**Signs of Seriousness**

- Pain on palpation of muscle masses, indicating muscle ischaemia.
- Hypoanaesthesia, which rapidly gives way to cutaneous anaesthesia.
- Paralysis, with the inability to move the toes, indicating the severity of the condition.

This picture can be summed up in the ""6P semiology"" of the Anglo-Saxons: Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Perishing cold.

The absence of motor deficit defines incomplete ischaemia.

Complementary tests are of no help in making a positive diagnosis, which is exclusively clinical. They should not delay emergency treatment in a specialist hospital. The emergency is absolute when the acute ischaemia is complete, i.e., when there is a motor deficit.

Revascularisation must be carried out before the sixth hour following the onset of the clinical picture to reduce the ischaemic suffering time of the tissues and avoid neurological, muscular, or cutaneous sequelae.

Any delay in this management could lead to the development of an outdated form of ischaemia, characterised by the appearance of muscular rigidity, skin mottling, and phlyctenes, necessitating first-line amputation to avoid death.",0.8,15.15571428571429,False,True,0.7832525372505188,0.557690421740214,c,False,2,3

1. **Diagnosis** (cf CEGO Acute gravidic cystitis (clinical) 2C-028-DP-A01 and Acute gravidic cystitis (biological diagnosis) 2C-028-DP-A02)

   - The clinical presentation of cystitis is unchanged in pregnant women. However, be wary of pollakiuria, which is a frequent symptom in the absence of any pathology, particularly in the 3rd trimester.
   - An ECBU with antibiotic susceptibility testing is recommended.
   - Diagnosis is made if leucocyturia ‚â• 10<sup>4</sup>/mL and bacteriuria ‚â• 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL for *E. coli* or *Staphylococcus saprophyticus* and ‚â• 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL for other enterobacteria, enterococci, *Corynebacterium urealyticum*, *P. aeruginosa* and *S. aureus*.
   - Probabilistic treatment should be started without waiting for the antibiogram result.

2. **Treatment** (cf CEGO Acute gravidic cystitis (treatment) 2C-028-PC-A02)

   - Probabilistic treatment should be started without waiting for the results of the antibiogram.
   - Current recommendations for antibiotic treatment are (molecules in order of prescription preference):
     - Bosfomycin-Trometamol in 1 dose
     - Pivmecillinam for 7 days
   - A follow-up ECBU 8 to 10 days after stopping treatment, followed by a monthly ECBU until delivery.

3. **Urinary Colonisation in Pregnant Women**

   - Urinary colonisation (‚â• 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL) in a pregnant woman must be treated. Treatment adapted to the results of the antibiogram must be started as soon as the results are received (no probabilistic treatment). Treatment with amoxicillin for 7 days is the first-line antibiotic. A follow-up ECBU 8 to 10 days after stopping treatment, followed by a monthly ECBU, is recommended until delivery.

== 1. Eliminate hazards ==  
Eliminating the use of hazardous chemicals, redesigning premises to avoid the risk of falls, etc., and changing work processes.  

Sometimes it is impossible to eliminate the danger: for example, wood dust is a carcinogen, but we cannot suggest to a woodworker that he stop using wood. Therefore, proceed to Step 2.

== 2. Limit emissions at source ==  
Limit their dispersion in the workplace by means of collective protective equipment. Examples include working in an enclosed space, extraction of emissions, installation of an extractor hood when using solvents, enclosure of a noisy machine, and organisation of work to reduce the number of people in the room.  

In the case of wood dust: dust extraction at source.  

If you have to do a lot of dusty jobs and the suction is inadequate, proceed to Step 3.

== 3. Limit employee exposure ==  
Achieved by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment such as gloves, breathing masks, goggles, and ear muffs.  

Example in the case of wood dust: wear a respiratory protection mask that has been chosen to be suitable (not all masks are equally useful or effective) and sufficiently comfortable to wear.

**Description:** Understanding the PSA assay and its guidelines for effective early individual diagnosis  
**Rubric:** Additional Tests  

**PSA Testing Guidelines:**

- PSA is a serum marker (enzyme protein) routinely used. It is specific to the prostate epithelium but not exclusive to prostate cancer.
- Certain conditions (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis) or prostate manipulations can increase PSA levels. The PSA level is influenced by the prostate's volume.
- Some medications (e.g., 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors) can artificially lower PSA levels.

- The threshold value for concern is 4 ng/ml, but this should be adjusted based on prostate volume and patient age. An initial elevated test must be confirmed by a second elevated test within 3 months. A consistent increase in PSA over several tests (> 0.75 ng/ml per year) should prompt a search for prostate cancer.

- Early individual diagnosis should be offered only to informed patients with a life expectancy of over 10 years.
- Early diagnosis is recommended starting at age 50 (or 40-45 if risk factors are present) and continues until age 70. It involves a digital rectal examination (DRE) and a PSA test every 2-4 years, although the optimal frequency is not yet established.

- An abnormal DRE and/or a PSA > 4 ng/ml (confirmed at least once) should lead to further diagnosis.
- This involves multiparametric prostate and pelvic MRI followed by ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies. Prostate MRI is systematically performed before biopsy. MRI can detect suspicious lesions and guide targeted biopsies. If PSA or DRE results are abnormal, a normal prostate MRI does not eliminate the need for a biopsy. MRI images are classified using the PI-RADS score (1-2: low risk of cancer, 3: equivocal, 4-5: significant risk of cancer). PI-RADS 3, 4, and 5 images are biopsied in addition to the 12 systematic prostate biopsy samples.",1.0,11.693684210526317,False,True,0.79781174659729,0.8771053949991862,c,False,5,4

**Rubric:** Taking Charge

In order to encourage the development of the child's skills and those of their family, and to enable the child to participate as much as possible in family life and society (Situation of disability SD-345), multidisciplinary care is proposed.

A care plan that includes the family and focuses on the objectives of the child and their family is defined by the team. It specifies the objectives, the actions to achieve them, and the evaluations.

Care should begin as early as possible, as soon as a deficit appears or a gap is noted, even in the absence of a formal diagnosis, to avoid delays (Psychomotor development abnormality SD-115). Most often, families spot these disorders. The medical consultation should enable the child to be positioned in relation to typical development and, if necessary, explore the disorders. This includes a Paediatric follow-up consultation and the announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family.

The health record is a good tool for screening and sharing.

It comprises three areas of care: medical, re-educational, and, if necessary, psychological.

- **Medical Aspect:** Aims to diagnose the aetiology of the disability, prevent potential complications linked to deficiencies and activity limitations, and propose strategies to enable the child to achieve maximum competence and independence. The doctor intervenes by prescribing medication, rehabilitation, technical aids, etc. Different doctors may be involved: the PRM, the paediatrician, the general practitioner, the surgeon.

- **Rehabilitation:** Involves different professionals depending on the assessed deficit: physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, psychomotor therapists, orthoptists, orthoprosthetists, chiropodists, etc.

In addition to measures to deal with impairments and disabilities, measures to deal with disabilities can also be put in place. In school, a personalised schooling project (PPS) or an individualised reception project can be proposed, and an AESH can help a child with a disability. The MDPH can set up a personalised education plan and provide financial assistance.

A social worker can be called in to help the family with the formalities (Comprehensive support for a carer SD-330).",0.8,12.286666666666669,False,True,0.8366396427154541,0.5147636334101359,c,False,4,3

**Description:** Know the Definition of Counterfeit Medicines

**Rubric:** Definition

**Definitions**

Counterfeiting a medicine is the deliberate and fraudulent misrepresentation of a medicine:

- Its identity: name, composition, activity, or other details.
- And/or its source: manufacturer, country of manufacture, country of origin, marketing authorization holders, distribution stages.

It can be applied to:

- Specialties or generic products
- Products containing the correct ingredients/components, no active ingredient, an insufficient amount of active ingredient, or products whose packaging has been tampered with.

Dating from 1992, this World Health Organization (WHO) definition serves as a reference. The same definition was extended to counterfeit health products by the International Medicines Products Anti-Counterfeiting Task Force (IMPACT) in 2008.

**Not to be Confused With:**

- Patent infringement or patent litigation
- Unregistered products: medical products (generics or specialties) that are not authorized for sale in a given country but are authorized for sale elsewhere.
- Unintentionally inferior products: batches that do not meet standards, quality defects, or failure to comply with good manufacturing or distribution practices.

""Fake medicines"" have a broader definition to extend the scope of the WHO's fight against counterfeit medicines:

- Counterfeit medicines: the concept of intellectual property protection varies greatly from country to country.
- Patent infringement: requires chemical analysis of the product.
- Trademark infringement: e.g., imitation packaging.

The term ""counterfeiting,"" which is ambiguous, is therefore being abandoned.

Several texts have been adopted to strengthen this fight, including the Council of Europe Convention on counterfeiting of medical products and similar crimes threatening public health (known as Medicrime).",0.8,13.470000000000002,False,True,0.8423158526420593,0.7689883907636007,a,False,1,4

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

Damage to the optic nerve is responsible for a unilateral drop in visual acuity, with impairment of the photomotor reflex and damage to the visual field (scotoma). The recent onset of papilledema requires urgent brain imaging to rule out any intracranial expansive process.

**Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy (NOIA)**  
NOIA is characterized by the following:  
- Mostly elderly patients  
- Sudden, painless, unilateral decrease in visual acuity, usually massive  
- Decrease in direct photomotor reflex  
- Total or sectorial papilledema  
- Fascicular deficit on visual field examination  

The most common cause is arteriosclerosis, but NOIA should be systematically investigated for Horton's disease, which requires urgent systemic corticosteroid therapy.

**Retrobulbar Optic Neuritis (NORB)**  
NORB is characterized by the following:  
- Young patients (20-40 years)  
- Rapidly progressive decrease in visual acuity over a few hours to a few days, usually unilateral  
- Very frequent eye pain, increased by eye movements  
- When the affected eye is illuminated, the direct photomotor reflex is reduced, as is the consensual reflex in the healthy eye  
- When the healthy eye is illuminated, an afferent pupillary deficit (Marcus Gunn pupil) on the affected side is demonstrated: alternating illumination of the pupils in the dark reveals paradoxical dilation of the pupil on the affected side  
- Normal fundus examination (more rarely, moderate papilledema)  
- Central or caecocentral scotoma on visual field examination  
- Colour vision examination typically shows dyschromatopsia with a red-green axis  
- Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are very impaired in the acute stage. On the healthy contralateral eye, they may show a lengthening of latency times, reflecting a slowing of conduction suggestive of demyelination lesions  

The risk of developing multiple sclerosis after an isolated episode of optic neuropathy is 30% on average at 5 years. The main risk factors are:  
- The presence of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the time of the first examination  
- Intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis  

**Toxic and Metabolic Optic Neuropathies**  
These neuropathies are manifested by bilateral and progressive damage. They are dominated by four causes:  
- Alcohol-induced optic neuropathy: Favoured by associated smoking, it typically presents on examination of the visual field with a bilateral cecocentral scotoma. In the absence of withdrawal, it leads to the development of optic atrophy.  
- Drug-induced optic neuropathy: Observed mainly during treatment for tuberculosis (ethambutol and isoniazid). They can cause a permanent reduction in visual acuity, hence the need for regular systematic monitoring of patients treated by examination of the visual field and above all colour vision, as these optic neuropathies are revealed early by red-green dyschromatopsia.  
- Occupational optic neuropathies (e.g., lead)  
- Metabolic optic neuropathies: In particular diabetes  

**Tumoral Optic Neuropathies**  
These include:  
- Intraorbital tumours of any kind: Tumours of the optic nerve (glioma) or its sheaths (meningioma), compression of the optic nerve by an intraorbital tumour. They most often result in optic atrophy associated with exophthalmos.  
- Tumours of the anterior part of the skull (sphenoid meningioma, etc.)  

**Papilledema**  
The papilla is hyperemic, with blurred edges.  
- Unilateral papilledema, with reduced visual acuity, suggests a vascular cause, particularly if associated with flare haemorrhages.

# Know the Objectives and Principles of Materiovigilance

## Definition and Objectives of Materiovigilance

The aim of materiovigilance is to monitor incidents or risks of incidents resulting from the use of medical devices (MDs) after they have been placed on the market. It applies to all medical devices, regardless of their class or state of sterility.

The aim of material vigilance is to ensure the safety of patients and users by:

- Monitoring medical devices after they have been placed on the market
- Preventing the (re)occurrence of incidents and risks of incidents involving medical devices
- Taking appropriate preventive and/or corrective action

## Organisation of Materiovigilance

Materiovigilance is organised at three levels: national, regional, and local.

### National Level

At the national level, materiovigilance is the responsibility of the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM). The ANSM:

- Records and investigates incidents and potential incidents reported to it
- Informs manufacturers and takes public health decisions if necessary, and informs the various parties involved
- Handles downstream alerts (batch withdrawals, safety information, etc.) from manufacturers
- Maintains its national register of local pharmacovigilance correspondents

### Regional Level

At the regional level, the regional materiovigilance coordinator (CRMRV):

- Ensures the regional assessment of material vigilance and reactovigilance reports
- Alerts the ANSM in the event of a potential signal constituting a threat to public health
- Coordinates and leads the regional network of local material vigilance correspondents (CLMV) and reactovigilance correspondents (CLRV)
- Provides expertise and support to Regional Health Agencies, CLMVs, CLRVs, and healthcare professionals in the field of material vigilance
- Takes part in the ANSM's permanent scientific committee on material vigilance
- Leads or participates in investigations or work carried out by the ANSM

### Local Level

Local material safety correspondents (CLMV):

- Report incidents related to a medical device
- Raise awareness of material vigilance among users
- Record and disseminate downstream alerts",1.0,15.45,False,True,0.82201087474823,0.7720881899197897,c,False,1,3

**Title:** Know the principles and main measures for the prevention of infectious diseases transmissible from human to human and from environment to environment in the community.

**Description:** None

Measures to prevent human-to-human and environmental infectious diseases are based on knowledge of the chain of transmission of the infectious agent in question. There may be several such measures for the same disease, and they may aim to control the reservoir, interrupt the chain of transmission, and/or act on the susceptibility of the host.

**1. Examples of Checking Tanks or Their Exit Doors**

- Use of a condom
- Expulsion from school or a community center, time off work
- Geographical isolation of carriers as part of additional precautions during treatment
- Veterinary measures if the reservoir is an animal
- Environmental sanitation, water treatment, eradication of insect and mollusc larvae

**2. Main Barriers to Transmission: Contact, Air, Droplets**

- Hand and respiratory hygiene in the community
- Domestic hygiene
- Quality and safety of care. Patient safety. Risk management. Undesirable events associated with care (EIAS). Standard and complementary precautions in the care environment

**3. Examples of Control of Animate or Inert Vectors**

- Food hygiene
- Veterinary control
- Vector control
- Maintenance and sterilization of medical devices during treatment

**4. Acting on Host Susceptibility**

- Control of entry points (wearing a mask, dressing skin lesions, etc.)
- Medication prophylaxis after exposure to the infectious agent
- Passive immunization (immunoglobulins)
- Active immunization (vaccination)

**5. Standard Precautions (SP)**

- SP must be applied daily by all healthcare professionals, for all care, in all places, and for all patients, regardless of their infection status.
- SPs reduce the risk of cross-transmission of infectious agents between carers, patients, and the environment, or through exposure to a biological product of human origin (blood, secretions, excreta, etc.). They contribute to the prevention of healthcare-associated infections, control of the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and healthcare safety during patient care.
- The prerequisites for the application of the SPs include up-to-date vaccinations, correct personal hygiene, clean working clothes that clear the forearms, zero jewelry on the hands and forearms, and tied-up hair if it is long.
- The recommendations concerning SP include:
  - Hand hygiene promoting disinfection with a hydroalcoholic solution
  - Wearing personal protective equipment (gloves, protection of clothing with a plastic apron or overblouse, and of the face with a surgical mask and protective goggles)
  - Respiratory hygiene measures
  - Prevention of fecal peril (excreta management)
  - Prevention of accidents involving exposure to blood
  - Measures to manage environmental contamination

**6. Complementary Precautions**

When a specific infectious risk is identified, ""additional precautions"" must be added to the SPs to control this risk.

- In the case of contact with a patient presenting a transmissible infection through contact (scabies, Clostridioides difficile diarrhea, carriage of multi-resistant or highly resistant bacteria), there are recommendations for additional contact precautions.
- When in contact with a patient presenting a transmissible respiratory or ENT infection, there are recommendations for additional droplet precautions (PCG) or air precautions (PCA), including wearing a suitable mask (surgical mask for PCG, FFP2 mask for PCA).

- **By Droplets:** Transmission through respiratory droplets.
- **Airborne:** Diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, and chickenpox.

**2. Direct Horizontal Transmission from an Animal to a Person (Zoonosis)**

- **By Direct Contact:** When bitten by an animal, such as rabies from foxes, dogs, and bats.
- **By Direct Contact or Inhalation:** Through aerosols of biological fluids or contaminated excrement, such as leptospirosis from rodent urine.
- **Through Consumption of Animal-Origin Food:** Particularly meat (e.g., variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, Escherichia coli EHEC) or dairy products (e.g., listeriosis, brucellosis).

**3. Indirect Horizontal Transmission Between the Reservoir and the Host via an Intermediary**

- **Vehicle or Inert Environmental Medium:**
  - **Food or Drinking Water:** Contaminated by biological fluids or excrement, causing diseases like typhoid fever (salmonellosis), shigellosis, cholera, amoebiasis, hepatitis A, poliomyelitis, and seasonal gastroenteritis.
  - **Soils:** Diseases such as tetanus and certain helminthoses (e.g., ankylostomosis, strongyloidosis).
  - **Fresh Water Bathing:** Diseases like schistosomiasis.
  - **Airborne Particles:** From an environmental reservoir, such as aspergillosis and legionellosis (water aerosols).

- **Living Vectors:** Actively transmit the infectious agent between an infected host and a receptive host (person or animal). Examples include:
  - **Arthropods:** Mosquitoes (e.g., malaria, dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis), ticks (e.g., Lyme disease, rickettsioses), flies (e.g., leishmanioses transmitted by sandflies), and lice (e.g., epidemic typhus transmitted by body lice).
  - **Intermediate Hosts:** Essential in the life cycle of the pathogen but do not ensure active transmission, such as molluscs (e.g., schistosomoses, distomatoses) and livestock (e.g., human teniasis).

**4. Vertical Transmission from Mother to Child**

- **Transplacental Passage:** Diseases such as toxoplasmosis (if primary maternal infection), rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy, listeriosis, and syphilis.
- **Transcervical Ascending Route:** Neonatal infection with Streptococcus agalactiae.
- **During Birth or Breast-feeding:** Infections such as HIV, hepatitis B, and neonatal herpes.",1.0,13.080000000000002,False,True,0.7262516617774963,0.5151355266571045,c,False,5,4

**Rubric:** Management  

The practice of anaesthesia is governed by safety decrees included in the public health code.

In the event of a scheduled procedure requiring general or locoregional anaesthesia:

1. A pre-anaesthetic consultation, carried out at least 2 days before a scheduled operation, valid for 1 month (unless anaesthetic advice is sought).  
2. A pre-anaesthetic visit carried out within 24 hours prior to a scheduled operation.  
3. The resources required to carry out the anaesthetic procedure. The anaesthetic process for a planned procedure requiring general or locoregional anaesthesia is detailed in the process overview.  
4. Continuous monitoring after the procedure.  
5. An organisation capable of dealing with complications arising from the operation or anaesthesia at any time.  

The anaesthetic process as a whole is summarised in the preoperative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. The anaesthetic process is identical for both general and locoregional anaesthesia.

In the event of an emergency operation, the anaesthetic process is adapted to the degree of urgency of the situation.",0.9,19.349999999999998,False,True,0.8079216480255127,0.8868825833002726,b,False,4,3
